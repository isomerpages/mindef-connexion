## Annexation of Crimea

In February 2014, groups of armed men without labelled uniforms started occupying important public places in Crimea, a peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea in Eastern Europe that was part of Ukraine. Soon, masked gunmen occupied the Crimean parliament building and raised a Russian flag. By March, Crimea had been incorporated into Russia, amid an international outcry. The unidentified soldiers turned out to be Russian.
 
Russia’s annexation of Crimea serves to provide lessons to the world, in particular to small countries like Singapore, on the realities of international politics and the importance of having a credible deterrent force.

The offensive included subversion and subterfuge through disinformation on social media. Russian channels propagated information in Ukraine that turned the population against the European Union and consequently supported the Kremlin. One claim was that Ukraine’s ethnic Russians were being oppressed and attacked – a video on Russian television supposedly showed the Ukrainian military firing on civilians, when the men filmed were actually Russian militia. The Russian hostile information campaigns against Ukraine worked when Crimea held a referendum to leave Ukraine and was eventually annexed.

#### The importance of a strong defence for small nations 

The development in Ukraine sent shockwaves through Europe and holds lessons for Singapore, which was shared by former Minister for Foreign Affairs K Shanmugam during the Committee of Supply Debates (COS) in March 2014.

The first key lesson is that while international law is important, it must be backed up by a strong will and a credible force deterrent. In the case of Ukraine, its sovereignty and independence was confirmed by a treaty – called the Budapest Memorandum – signed in 1994 by Russia with the United States and the United Kingdom. This was in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons.

But this agreement was cast aside in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US and UK did not take action against Russia’s violation of the treaty as well. Treaties have to be backed by an ability to enforce them. Ukraine could not defend the treaty, and had no partners come to its aid – so the treaty by itself did not help Ukraine.

The second key point is that in international relations, size matters. A small country that cannot protect itself puts its sovereignty and its people at risk. Russia is a nuclear power, and Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 treaty. Russia is also vastly bigger than Ukraine, and its armed forces are much more powerful than the Ukraine armed forces. 

The third key lesson is that we must ultimately be responsible for our own defence. The United Nations Security Council is an important pillar in ensuring global peace but it cannot always guarantee stability or act decisively to secure protection for smaller countries.

And the fourth lesson is simply that small countries may be used as pawns between larger powers.
 
Said Mr Shanmugam: “When squeezed between two big powers or blocs, a smaller country like Ukraine can become a pawn. The country caught in between can be sacrificed if the two contending powers or blocs decide to reach a wider accommodation with each other, trading off their various interests. This has happened frequently in history – for example, to Poland. Smaller countries must always be aware of this.”
