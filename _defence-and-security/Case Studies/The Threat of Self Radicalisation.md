## The Threat of Self-Radicalisation

Today, there is an increasing number of terrorist attacks being carried out by self-radicalised individuals and lone wolf actors on everyday venues, using ordinary objects such as knives and vehicles. The radicalised individuals are also significantly younger, have no prior terror links, and are influenced by extremist propaganda on social media. 

Groups such as ISIS have used social media to spread their ideology. The proliferation of extremist content online means easy access to such material, especially in a country as digitally connected as Singapore. The result is that some individuals in Singapore have become self-radicalised after being exposed to such content.

Self-radicalisation takes place when individuals consume such propaganda and start to believe in the ideology behind them. They then start to act on the ideology, which often calls for violent and physical attacks against specific institutions, people or groups. These can include innocent citizens, groups of a particular religious faith or even the government. Through the years, Singaporeans influenced by ISIS teachings have even travelled to Syria to fight.

Here are some examples of self-radicalisation in Singapore: 

In December 2020, a 16-year-old Singaporean male was detained after making plans to attack Muslims, the youngest person then to be detained for terrorism-related activities.  The Secondary 4 student was influenced by the 2019 terror attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, having watched the livestreamed video of the attack and read the manifesto of the perpetrator. 

A 22-year-old Singaporean became the first woman to be detained under the ISA for radicalism in 2017. She was a contract infant care assistant with a PCF Sparkletots Preschool, and began to be radicalised in 2013 by online ISIS propaganda. She had been planning to travel to Syria with her young child and was looking for an ISIS supporter to marry.

A former full-time national serviceman, 20, was detained in March 2021 for planning a knife attack on Jews. He had been enraged by the Israel-Palestine conflict and made plans to travel to Gaza to join the fight against Israel.

In June 2021, a 34-year-old Singaporean housewife and former religious teacher was detained for planning to travel to Syria and fight for ISIS. She was radicalised by her husband who was arrested a year earlier.

Apart from Singaporeans, there have been multiple instances of foreigners getting radicalised in Singapore. Since 2015, more than 40 Bangladeshi workers and 21 foreign domestic workers were found to have been radicalised.
