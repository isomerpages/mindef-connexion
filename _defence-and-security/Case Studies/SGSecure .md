#### Strengthening the Community to Fight Terrorism

The government continues to enhance our counter-terrorism capabilities but our community response is equally critical in our fight against terrorism. In 2006, the government started the Community Engagement Programme, or CEP, which began as an initiative to preserve and strengthen communal harmony and cohesion in the aftermath of a terror attack. Over time, the CEP expanded its objectives to also prepare our people to be resilient and better prepared for any crisis or emergency.

Building on the work of the CEP, the CEP was later revamped and expanded to become the SGSecure movement which was launched in 2016 to sensitise, train and mobilise the community in the fight against terror.

It focuses on three core actions: Staying Alert, Staying United and Staying Strong. SGSecure programmes have been introduced in our neighbourhoods, schools, workplaces and religious organisations to raise awareness of the terrorism threat and increase community vigilance. Emergency preparedness skills training were also made more easily accessible to improve community preparedness. Other programmes include activities that strengthen social cohesion, such as inter-faith activities. 

SGSecure has also roped in technology in the fight. The SGSecure app allows users to submit information on suspicious sightings and receive alerts and updates in the event of major emergencies. 

The SGSecure Responders’ Network was also launched in November 2019 to encourage members of the public to be active responders. Anyone can be a SGSecure Responder and members of the public can join easily through the SGSecure app. The “Respond” feature in the app allows Responders to be mobilised to help people in distress, such as by responding to cardiac arrest or minor fires around them.  

The Home Team also works closely with the community in other areas such as the Community Policing System which leverages technology and community partnerships as one of many ways to keep our neighbourhoods safe.

In the light of perpetual resource constraints and changing security challenges, Singapore has to continually adapt its approach to defence and homefront security. This means having a more coordinated response to emergencies, involving the population in defence and security as well as ensuring the strength of the defence force and security force. Innovation and technology will also keep Singapore at an advantage, while deterrence and diplomacy form a time-tested platform for our defence. 

These, coupled with the ability to adapt, innovate and stay resilient, will help secure the nation for decades to come.
