### National Service Through the Years

When Singapore became independent in 1965, one immediate task was to build up our defence.

Before the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was formed, there was the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps (SVRC) that was formed in 1854 following violent riots in Singapore. It was later renamed the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC) in 1901, and eventually became the People’s Defence Force (PDF) in 1965. The defence force back then depended on volunteers to supplement the local constabulary for internal security and to defend Singapore against external threats. However, Singapore could not depend solely on volunteers for its security.

As Singapore has limited manpower, we cannot have a regular armed force of sufficient size to deter external aggressors. It is also highly unlikely that voluntary National Service (NS) would provide a sufficient number of capable volunteers who would complete full-time NS and In-Camp Training (ICT). Neither can we rely on mercenaries or soldiers who are paid to fight for us. In a real crisis, mercenaries cannot be trusted to defend a country that is not their own.
	
Hence, the government decided to introduce compulsory conscription of male youths as the best way to build up Singapore’s defence force. The NS (Amendment) Act was introduced in 1967 and a call-up was initiated for 9,000 youths born between 1 January and 30 June 1949. The first batch of full-time national servicemen (NSFs) enlisted into the SAF, the PDF, the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary.

Since the inception of NS, more than a million people have gone through the NS rite of passage, serving in the SAF, Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The SPF took in their first batch of NSFs in 1975 and the SCDF followed suit in 1981. During the Hotel New World collapse in 1986, SCDF Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) were mobilised in the nation-wide effort to conduct search-and-rescue operations to save lives – 17 people were rescued.

When NS was first introduced, officers served three years and other ranks served two years, followed by 10 years of reserve service. In 1971, the length of service was changed to two-and-a-half years for servicemen holding the rank of Corporal and above. In 1983, the reservist training cycle was extended from 10 to 13 years to meet operational needs. In 2005, because of improvements in training and technology, the duration of full-time NS was reduced from two-and-a-half years to two years. The Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) duration was also shortened from 13 to 10 years in 2006. 
	
To further complement the regular force, volunteer SAF schemes have also been set up as the SAF expands operational capabilities. For instance, operationally-ready national servicemen (NSmen) have been able to take on roles such as legal advisers, dentists, nurses and radiographers in the SAF. In 2014, the SAF Volunteer Corps (SAFVC) was launched for non-NS-liable Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) – such as women, first-generation PRs and new citizens. This allows a greater number of Singapore citizens and PRs to contribute to national defence, show support for NS, and deepen their understanding and ownership of national defence.
