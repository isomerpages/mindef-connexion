When Singapore became independent in 1965, one immediate task was to build up our defence.

	“The most important thing is our defence. It was a simple question of survival or being destroyed by others. If we want to survive and not be destroyed by others, then we must unite and be prepared to fight to defend ourselves.” – Founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s speech at the 5th anniversary celebration at Yio Chu Kang Community Centre on 18 December 1965.

Before the SAF was formed, there was the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps that was formed in 1854 following violent riots in Singapore. It was later renamed the Singapore Volunteer Corps in 1901, and eventually became the People’s Defence Force (PDF) in 1965. The defence force back then depended on volunteers to supplement the local constabulary for internal security and to defend Singapore against external threats. However, Singapore could not depend solely on volunteers for its security. 
	
As we have limited manpower, we cannot have a regular armed force of sufficient size as it would be expensive to maintain and have economic implications on our country. It is also highly unlikely that voluntary National Service (NS) would provide a sufficient number of capable volunteers who would complete full-time NS and In-Camp Training (ICT). Neither could we rely on mercenaries or soldiers who are paid to fight for us. In a real crisis, mercenaries cannot be trusted to loyally defend a country that is not their own.
	
Hence, the Singapore government decided to introduce compulsory conscription of male youths as the best way to build up Singapore’s defence force quickly without burdening the country’s financial and manpower resources. The NS (Amendment) Act was introduced in 1967 and a call-up was initiated for 9,000 youths born between 1 January and 30 June 1949. The first batch of full-time NSmen enlisted into the SAF, the PDF, the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary. 
	
Since the inception of NS, more than a million people have gone through the NS rite of passage, serving in the SAF, Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The SPF took in their first batch of Full-time NSmen (NSFs) in 1975 and the SCDF followed suit in 1981. The NSFs were deployed for both peacetime and emergency functions. 
	
In 1981, the SCDF enlisted its first intake to provide emergency services. This group was tested in 1986 with the Hotel New World collapse when SCDF personnel had to conduct search-and-rescue operations to save lives – 17 people were rescued.
	
When NS was first introduced, officers served three years and other ranks served two years, followed by 10 years of reserve service. In 1971, the length of service was changed to two-and-a-half years for servicemen holding the rank of Corporal and above. In 1983, the reservist training cycle was extended from 10 to 13 years to meet operational needs. In 2005, because of improvements in training and technology, the duration of full-time NS was reduced from two-and-a-half years to two years. The Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) duration was also shortened from 13 to 10 years in 2006. 
	
To complement the regular force of more than 20,000 professional soldiers, volunteer SAF schemes have also been set up as the SAF expands operational capabilities. For instance, ORNS have been able to take on roles such as legal advisers, dentists, nurses and radiographers in the SAF. In 2014, the SAF Volunteer Corps was launched in 2014 for non-NS-liable Singaporeans and PRs – such as women, first-generation Permanent Residents (PRs) and new citizens. This allows a greater number of Singaporeans and PRs to contribute to national defence, show support for NS, and deepen their understanding and ownership of national defence.
	
Conscription through National Service is the only viable option to build up a strong and credible defence force to ensure the independence and sovereignty of Singapore. As the bedrock of our fighting force and national security, NS is critical for Singapore’s continued survival and success. While we try our best to build good diplomatic relations with others, at times we may need to stand firm from a position of strength. 
	
As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at a dinner commemorating 50 years of NS in 2017, NS and the efforts of servicemen have enabled the country to “enjoy decades of peace, and a safe and secure home”.
	
NS is still the critical need for a strong defence, to protect the Singapore that generations have built. We cannot afford to take our peace for granted and become complacent in peacetime. Our NSFs and NSmen fight alongside SAF regulars and are able to deploy sophisticated weapons, use powerful systems and pick up soldiering skills quickly. As the threat landscape evolves, they protect Singapore not only from armed conflicts but also from non-conventional threats like terrorism, and render aid in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), and assist in health epidemics such as SARS in 2003 and more recently, COVID-19. 
	
Over the years, NS has become a national institution that is accepted as our way of life. It has touched Singaporeans in one way or another and is the cornerstone of our national identity. It brings people from diverse racial, religious, language, and educational backgrounds to train, live and serve the country together. NS has since become a rite of passage, where boys grow to become men and life-long bonds are forged. Such common life-shaping experiences have helped to foster greater cohesiveness and national identity among our people. As security threats become more insidious and difficult to spot and manage, it becomes more important for society to rally behind and support our national servicemen and women.
