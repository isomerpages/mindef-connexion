## Hostile Information Campaigns 
A non-conventional threat that has grown in the digital age is the emergence of hostile information campaigns (HICs). In HICs, hostile foreign actors seek to manipulate political discourse and harm a country’s interest by carrying out coordinated and sophisticated online communications activities to manipulate public opinion. The Internet’s anonymity and the prevalent use of social media give hostile actors a vast and easily accessible playing field.

HICs can be part of an overall hybrid threat, one which combines various attacks on a target. For instance, a country can embark on a “hack-and-leak” operation, mounting cyberattacks with a view to obtaining information that can be used to undermine trust in the target’s official institutions. 

As Singapore works towards being a Smart Nation, digital technology will pervade all aspects of our lives. While the digital revolution presents opportunities for Singapore, it also makes us vulnerable to threats from the digital domain. Singapore’s size, hyper-connectivity and multi-ethnic and multi-religious society further make us a target.

During a period of tension with another country between 2016 and 2017, Singapore experienced the following, which attempted to undermine our foreign policy position. Online commentaries and videos were uploaded by social media accounts, which had lain dormant for many years. Many of these were in Mandarin and targeted at our Chinese-speaking population. These contents were also widely circulated via chat applications and aimed to influence sentiments among Singaporeans.

During a period of bilateral tension with a country in 2018, we saw a large spike in online comments critical of Singapore, and many came from anonymous accounts. They sought to give an artificial impression of widespread objection to Singapore’s position.

#### The Battle for Hearts and Minds

The battle for land takes place over the physical battlefield, but the war for minds and hearts is now being waged in the digital arena in today’s information-driven society. 

An example is how foreign state actors interfere in the elections of other countries. For many countries, elections are the main way by which a government is chosen to lead and organise society. By tampering or interfering with the elections, these state actors are looking to destabilise the target’s government or to influence results in their favour. 

For example, the US Government has alleged that Russia interfered in the 2020 US Presidential elections.  US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had backed Presidential candidate Donald Trump over Presidential candidate Joe Biden, with a Kremlin official attempting to discredit the election process.

In the United Kingdom, domestic unhappiness was exploited during the referendum on Brexit in 2016. Anti-immigration falsehoods were propagated by foreign-linked social media accounts to build a narrative that the government had failed to protect its citizens.

#### Interference Operations

Recently in Parliament, Singapore’s Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) referred to news that Russia had allegedly engaged in campaigns to erode trust in the European Union’s COVID-19 strategy, and to spread scepticism of Western-developed vaccines. While MCI noted that they did not detect clear evidence of this, it was being reported in the press by other countries.

Interference operations have existed since Singapore’s early years. In the 1970s, Singapore was the target of two interference operations involving newspapers, The Eastern Sun and the Singapore Herald, which received funding from foreign sources and in return, ran articles that sought to undermine nascent nation-building efforts. 

This illustrates how Singapore, as a highly connected, multi-religious and multiracial society, can become a target for divisive falsehoods. Through fake news, potential aggressors can exploit these vulnerabilities to cause harm to our country. Sometimes, regional conflicts can also spill over to Singapore. When local media outlets reported on Myanmar’s Rohingya humanitarian crisis in 2018, their social media pages attracted Islamophobic comments from Myanmar-based accounts. This then triggered a backlash from accounts that appeared to belong to Singaporean Muslim users, the Select Committee on fake news reported in 2018.

Fake news, if left to perpetuate through the digital domain, can have real and devastating effects. They may disrupt our way of life, affect our hearts and minds, influence our perceptions of issues and how we behave, reduce public confidence in public institutions and undermine our social cohesion and psychological resilience. 

In 2016, fake news of a collapsed roof in a Punggol HDB estate made its rounds, leading to police and Singapore Civil Defence Force officers attending to the false alarm.

Other instances of false reporting have threatened community harmony. Local-foreigner relations were endangered in 2017 after a survey claimed that over 60 per cent of foreign domestic workers in Singapore were exploited. In the same year, a social media post showed plain-clothed police at a Geylang Serai bazaar food stall, and claimed that non-halal food was being sold. However, the operation was to arrest unregistered foreign food handlers.

#### COVID-19 Pandemic 

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, multiple instances of fake news occurred. At its height, hundreds of fake news stories and fake government announcements were passed around through WhatsApp and Telegram groups and other social media platforms. One warned that supermarkets would only be open for two days a week, while others claimed that Singapore had run out of masks. This resulted in panic buying and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had to reassure the public there were sufficient supplies. The person who spread the fake news was caught and charged in court.

There were also other false messages on vaccine-related information that were circulated. Some claimed that the mRNA vaccines were ineffective against COVID-19 and its mutations, or even unsafe. Others claimed that the Sinovac virus vaccine could protect us better than mRNA, even as studies showed otherwise.

#### Efforts to counter HICs

To combat HICs, Parliament passed the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) in October 2021, which would provide for calibrated and targeted interventions against HICs. These include allowing the Government to require internet companies and others to provide information that could aid in an investigation of a HIC, and to provide for a range of interventions to disrupt the spread of HICs, including removing content and accounts. 

The government has embarked on a multi-pronged approach. One way is to be actively involved in addressing and debunking fake news through official sites such as www.gov.sg/factually. This website, set up in May 2012, is the government’s official online communication platform and repository which informs the public of the fake news out there and provides resources and explainers so that the public could better understand the actual situation. Singaporeans can check out the latest news about the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore on the Factually websites as well as other government policies. Various government agencies also provide real-time updates on their websites. For instance, the Ministry of Health would quickly post information that debunked fake news on its official website. When a Facebook post stated that a three-year-old pre-schooler had died from COVID-19 in August 2021, MOH clarified that the statement was false.

Besides new legislation, there is a need for a whole-of-society effort, from public education to a responsible media.

For example, the mainstream media can also play its part by broadcasting accurate and official news as well as advising people to refer to official sources of news instead.
