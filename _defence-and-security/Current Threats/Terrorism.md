## Terrorism 

Singapore has been struck by terrorist incidents in the past, such as the Laju incident in 1974 and SQ 117 hijacking by Pakistani extremists in 1991. However, these incidents were isolated and episodic, in contrast to the more widespread, transnational and sophisticated brand of terrorism that plagues Singapore and the region today. In recent years, Singapore has been targeted by terrorist groups and the terrorism threat to the country remains high, according to the Internal Security Department.

The events of September 11 in the United States in 2001 underscored the catastrophic impact of militant transnational terrorism and sparked a global response to terrorism, with the US waging a war on terror on Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terror group, Al-Qaeda, had hijacked four commercial planes; two crashed into the World Trade Centre, one plane hit the Pentagon just outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  Almost 3,000 people were killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the largest attack on American soil since the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour in World War 2.

Closer to home, the Al-Qaeda threat was localised when links were forged to its affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) group in Southeast Asia in the 1980s and 1990s. JI intended to set up a pan-Islamic state in Southeast Asia and had a branch in Singapore. It even planned to construct truck bombs to mount suicide attacks on Singapore targets, but the perpetrators were arrested by Singapore authorities before the attacks were carried out. On 9 December 2001, the Internal Security Department arrested six Singaporean JI members, thwarting plans to attack Yishun MRT station and several foreign embassies. In total, 36 persons were dealt with under the Internal Security Act in 2001 and 2002 for their involvement with the JI group.

The threat has not abated through the years. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which aims to establish a caliphate as an overarching global state over Muslims worldwide, remains a menace. 

The terror group originally began as part of Al-Qaeda but later rebranded itself and seized territory in Iraq and Syria from 2014. It represents a more sophisticated form of terrorism; while Al Qaeda fashioned itself as a rebel group, ISIS positioned itself as a legitimate state for all followers of its radical brand of Islam. It also used social media, the Internet and other media to propagate its ideology worldwide. The insidious approach helped recruit thousands of foreign fighters and spawned local groups to orchestrate attacks in regions like Southeast Asia, thousands of miles away from the Middle East.

In 2016, terrorists in Indonesia (including a Syrian-based Indonesian ISIS militant) planned a rocket attack on Marina Bay from Batam, just 18km away from downtown Singapore. The attack was foiled and six terror cell members were arrested by Indonesian police.

Global terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda have proven resilient and adaptable, despite their leadership losses and setbacks in recent years. Even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, they have stepped up their recruitment and propaganda on social media, encouraging their supporters to conduct attacks. There has also been international concern over the trend of foreign fighters for ISIS returning from Syria and Iraq to set up caliphates in their home regions. With its sizeable Muslim population, Southeast Asia has been a target for ISIS as the militant group declared Indonesia, Malaysia and parts of Southern Philippines as possible caliphates. About a thousand fighters from the region have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight, forming their own combat unit. After training there, some of these returning fighters return with the latest terror techniques and a network of radical contacts, elevating the terrorism threat in Southeast Asia. 

In recent years, far-right extremism has also emerged as a major terrorism concern overseas, and is the fastest-growing threat in some Western countries. This movement is inspired by ideologies such as neo-Nazism, neo-fascism and white nationalism. Many such groups believe that their race is inherently superior to others and that their country should only belong to a certain group of people. This has, in turn, led to problems such as anti-immigration and anti-foreigner sentiments, resulting in serious cases of racism and racist violence. 

In Singapore, self-radicalised actors influenced by Islamist and far-right extremist materials online are the main domestic terrorism threat, due to the ease of radicalisation and the difficulty in detecting these individuals. The trend of self-radicalisation in Singapore has persisted since 2019, and it is important that we remain vigilant against such threats.

#### Safeguarding Singapore against Terrorism
As an open society, Singaporeans are susceptible to influence by global developments which have spill-over effects, such as hate speech and divisive rhetorics. These may motivate at-risk individuals to plot and carry out attacks. 

The SAF and Home Team work together with members of the community to look out for signs of individuals around us who might be at risk or have become radicalised. The SAF enhances its capabilities against non-conventional threats by setting up the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive (CBRE) Defence group. Its high-readiness task forces, such as the Special Operations Task Force (SOTF) and Island Defence Task Force also stand ready to deal with any peacetime security threats. 

The SAF also supports Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)’s SGSecure movement, which prepares the public in the event of a terrorist attack. Our servicemen are trained to adapt their military skills and operational instincts to perform the role of “Active responders” in the event of an attack. The SGSecure movement aims to sensitise the public to the threat of radicalisation, and highlight the importance of pre-emptive action, such as reporting suspected radicalised individuals early. Together, the security agencies and the community work together to strengthen Singapore’s defences against terrorism, and safeguard our harmony and way of life.

The multiple instances of self-radicalisation show that it is not limited to any religion or ethnic group. It can also take place among different age groups, with varying socio-economic status. The terror threat is far more insidious now and resides within the community, and it may take more than law enforcement agencies to uncover terror plots. 

To this end, the role of a vigilant citizenry is vital. Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has called on the community to watch for signs of radicalisation, such as the consumption of radical materials, posting of such content on their social media and withdrawal from social life.

Singapore has also moved to deepen inter-religious and cross-cultural understanding as radicalisation is not limited to any religion or ethnic group. Additionally, the government has taken swift action to counter hate speech and moved to ban religious speakers espousing views that incite hatred on another race or religion. For instance, the Government banned Christian preacher Lou Engle following remarks he made in a sermon in Singapore.

A holistic approach also has to be taken to counter radicalisation, which also includes re-integrating those who have gone astray.
