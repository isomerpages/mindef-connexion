Singapore has been struck by terrorist incidents in the past, such as the Laju incident in 1974 and the SQ 117 hijacking by Pakistani extremists in 1991. However, these incidents were isolated and episodic, in contrast to the more widespread, transnational and sophisticated brand of terrorism that plagues Singapore and the region today. In recent years, Singapore has been identified by terrorist groups as a target, and the threat of terrorism remains high.

The events of September 11, 2001 (9/11) in the United States (US) underscored the catastrophic impact of militant transnational terrorism and sparked a global response to terrorism, with the US waging a war on terror on Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terror group, Al-Qaeda, had hijacked four commercial planes; two were crashed into the World Trade Centre twin towers in New York City, one plane hit the Pentagon just outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Almost 3,000 people were killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the largest attack on American soil since the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour in World War 2.

Closer to home, Al-Qaeda had forged links to its affiliate, the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) group, in Southeast Asia in the 1980s and 1990s. JI intended to set up a pan-Islamic state in Southeast Asia and had a branch in Singapore. It even planned to construct truck bombs to mount suicide attacks on Singapore targets, but the perpetrators were arrested by Singapore authorities before the attacks were carried out. On 9 December 2001, the Internal Security Department (ISD) arrested six Singaporean JI members, thwarting plans to attack Yishun MRT station and several foreign embassies. In total, 36 persons were arrested during ISD’s operations against the JI group in 2001 and 2002.

The threat has not abated through the years. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which aims to establish a caliphate as an overarching global state over Muslims worldwide, remains a menace even though it has lost its territory in Iraq and Syria. 

ISIS originally began as part of Al-Qaeda but later rebranded itself and seized territory in Iraq and Syria from 2014. It represents a more sophisticated form of terrorism; while Al-Qaeda fashioned itself as a rebel group, ISIS positioned itself as a legitimate state for all followers of its radical brand of Islam. It also used social media, the Internet and other media to propagate its ideology worldwide. This insidious approach helped recruit thousands of foreign fighters and spawned local groups to orchestrate attacks in regions like Europe and Southeast Asia, thousands of miles away from the Middle East.

Global terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda have proven resilient and adaptable, despite their leadership losses and military setbacks in recent years. Even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, they have stepped up their recruitment and propaganda on social media, encouraging their supporters to conduct attacks. There has been international concern over the possibility of foreign fighters for ISIS returning from the Middle East to set up terrorist cells in their home regions. 

With its sizeable Muslim population, Southeast Asia has been a target for ISIS, and its affiliates have declared Indonesia, Malaysia and parts of Southern Philippines as its possible territory. About a thousand fighters from the region have travelled to the Middle East to fight, forming their own combat unit. After training there, some of these fighters have returned with combat experience and a network of radical contacts, elevating the terrorism threat in Southeast Asia. 

In 2016, pro-ISIS terrorists in Indonesia (who received instructions from a Syrian-based Indonesian ISIS militant) planned a rocket attack on Marina Bay Sands from Batam, just 18km away from downtown Singapore. The attack was foiled with the arrest of six terror cell members by Indonesian police in August 2016.

In recent years, far-right extremism has also emerged as a major terrorism concern overseas, and is the fastest-growing threat in some Western countries. This movement is inspired by ideologies such as neo-Nazism, neo-fascism and white nationalism. Many such groups believe that their race is inherently superior to others and that their country should only belong to a certain group of people. This has, in turn, led to problems such as anti-immigration and racial supremacist sentiments, resulting in serious cases of racism and racist violence. 

In 2020, a 16-year-old Singaporean youth made plans to attack Muslims at two mosques in Singapore, having been influenced by far-right extremist ideologies. These plans were foiled as he was detained under the Internal Security Act. Apart from the case of the 16-year-old youth, there is currently no indication that far-right extremism has gained significant traction in Singapore. However, this does not mean that we are immune to such threats. We have to stay vigilant and take a firm stand against any rhetoric that promotes hatred or animosity towards other communities, and draw the line at the pursuit of any violent action, regardless of how it is justified.

In Singapore, the main domestic terrorism threat comes from self-radicalised actors influenced by violent extremist materials online. The use of online and digital communications networks to recruit terrorists makes it difficult for authorities to detect the radicalised individuals. The trend of self-radicalisation in Singapore saw a sharp spike after 2015, following the emergence of ISIS. ISIS’ leadership and territorial losses in Syria and Iraq have not yet diminished the appeal of the group.  It is important that we remain vigilant against such threats.
