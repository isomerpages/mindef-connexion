#### The early tumultuous years: 1950s to 1970s

The regional security landscape from the 1950s to 1970s was fraught with uncertainty, with threats from bigger neighbours and the looming shadow of communism hanging over the region at the height of the Cold War. Singapore’s security concerns were exacerbated by domestic unrest in the form of riots and terrorism as well. 

Even as the Government strived to beef up our military to guard against external threats, there was also much to do to quell internal unrest. 

Against the backdrop of the Cold War, elements like the Malayan Community Party (MCP) used strategies of armed violence such as the armed revolt in the 1948 Malayan Emergency and united front tactics (such as mobilising the masses) to subvert organisations like trade unions, political parties and student groups. The rise of communism in the 1950s, inspired by the totalitarian systems of Stalin and Mao, clashed with the principles that backed Singapore’s democratic system and multiracial society. However, such totalitarian ideas, which called for a dictatorial form of government and the suppression of religious and civil rights, caught on in the region.

As a result, we had to grapple with domestic instability through the 1950s and 1960s as riots related to communism and communalism rocked the nation. The two were not always unrelated – political scientist Bilveer Singh wrote that communist elements in Singapore saw the Chinese community as “useful partners of the communist united front”, and instigated them against the authorities.

The government’s measures to clamp down on communist activities, such as disbanding pro-communist Chinese organisations, resulted in island-wide protests from thousands of Chinese middle school students in October 1956. Tensions swelled when students attacked police, sparking off violent riots across the country. When the disturbances ended, there were 13 deaths, 127 injured, and more than 1,000 arrested.

In 1964, Singapore had to deal with a series of racial riots in the thick of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) and tensions between the People’s Action Party (PAP) government in Singapore and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)-led Alliance Party government. 

Tensions boiled over during a procession to celebrate the Prophet Mohammad’s birthday in July 1964 which saw clashes between Malays and Chinese bystanders. News of these led to further communal violence across the island, leading to 23 deaths and 454 people injured.

In September, a second series of communal riots was ignited by the killing of a Malay trishaw rider, leading to 13 deaths and 106 people injured. This time, both Malaysian and Singapore governments directed blame towards Indonesian provocateurs who were part of Indonesia’s Konfrontasi policy aimed at weakening Malaysia.

Besides these riots, there were others such as the 1950 Maria Hertogh riots, the 1954 National Service demonstrations, the 1955 Hock Lee bus riots and the 1969 race riots in Malaysia which spilt over to Singapore. The violent riots led to numerous deaths and significant damage to both our physical infrastructure and social fabric.
