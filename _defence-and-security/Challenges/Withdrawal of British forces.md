#### Withdrawal of British forces

Amid such regional hostilities, we had to contend with a serious blow to our national defence. In July 1967, the British announced that they would be withdrawing their military from Singapore. The news was harsh but the lesson was clear: we could not depend on foreign powers to provide for our defence. The withdrawal of British forces illustrated the need to build our own military to protect ourselves from hostile forces.
