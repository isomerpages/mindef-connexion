## Withdrawal of British forces

Amid such regional hostilities, we had to contend with a serious blow to our national defence. In July 1967, the British announced that they would be withdrawing their military from Singapore. The news was harsh but the lesson was clear: we could not depend on foreign powers to provide for our defence. The withdrawal of British forces illustrated the need to build our own military to protect ourselves from hostile forces.  


#### Building a Defence Force

At Independence, Singapore’s external security was still very much in the hands of the British forces. But the vast British empire was being stretched thin with high defence expenditure and its weak economic performance, culminating in its withdrawal of most of its military forces East of Suez by 1971. For Singapore, this was a daunting prospect for not just our defence but our economy too, as British military bases were contributing over 20 per cent to Singapore’s gross national product.

On 18 July 1967, the dreaded news arrived. Britain announced that it would withdraw its troops from Singapore by the mid-1970s. The withdrawal was brought forward to 1971 later on. We were about to be left bereft of a meaningful defence and had to start relying on ourselves for the nation’s security. 

Situated in a rough neighbourhood, Singapore had only two infantry regiments and a volunteer militia then. With the region emerging as a theatre for the Cold War, the falling South Vietnamese domino looked like it might eventually topple Singapore. The communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975, with the withdrawal of the Americans, meant there was an open path for communism to take root in the region. One of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s primary concerns at independence was defending Singapore amid the threat of Konfrontasi and the regional communist insurgency. 

These circumstances set in motion Singapore’s arduous task to build a defence force from almost nothing. Even though the British had helped Malaya build an army in the 1950s, such assistance was not forthcoming this time. Mr Lee explained in his memoirs that the British felt Malaysia would want to be “our military instructors”, having sponsored Singapore’s membership both to the Commonwealth and the United Nations.

Dr Goh, the country’s first Defence Minister, had to build a defence force from scratch. Back then, his only military experience was as a corporal in the British-led Singapore Volunteer Corps. And since Singapore’s population was small, it would be difficult to build a sizeable defence force based on professional soldiers alone. The result was conscription – the beginning of National Service for all Singapore males.

Singapore, however, did not have any experience in building and training a defence force. The Government wrote to several countries, including India and Egypt, but they all declined to assist. Eventually, Dr Goh persuaded the Israelis to provide military training. 

The first batch of 900 national servicemen started their training on 17 August 1967. The 900 were the only ones who served as full-time servicemen, while the rest of the 9,000 eligible enlistees served part-time in the People’s Defence Force, the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary. 

Through a conscription army, a large pool of trained military and security personnel was quickly amassed and could be mobilised quickly. The Government also acquired British-made weaponry, such as Hawker Hunter fighters and Bloodhound missiles, to arm the soldiers.

By 1969, a show of military strength was demonstrated at Singapore’s National Day Parade, with a procession of tanks and armoured vehicles. Singapore could at last have a meaningful defence force to call our own and be proud of.
