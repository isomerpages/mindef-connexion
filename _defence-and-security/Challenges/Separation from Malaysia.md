#### Separation from Malaysia

Freshly independent after separation from Malaysia, Singapore’s foremost concern was defending ourselves and our “piece of real estate”, according to Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

The only two battalions in the country were still under command of a Malaysian brigadier, and there was a need to deter Malay Ultras (extremists) in Kuala Lumpur who were keen to reverse the independence acquired. Many KL leaders believed Singapore should never have been allowed to leave Malaysia, and was to be kept a part of the country, by force if necessary, Mr Lee revealed in his memoirs.

One episode came to illustrate Malaysia’s lingering military presence in Singapore. Mr Lee shared that Brigadier Syed Mohamed bin Syed Ahmad Alasgoff insisted on escorting him to the opening of the first independent Parliament in December 1965.

“I weighed up the situation and concluded that the Tunku wanted to remind us and the foreign diplomats who would be present that Malaysia was still in charge of Singapore.” – Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in From Third World to First: The Singapore Story – 1965 – 2000.

In 1966, the 1st Royal Malay Regiment (1 RMR) of the Malaysian Armed Forces occupied Camp Temasek, the barracks of the 2nd Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (2 SIR). This took place after 2 SIR was sent to Sabah for operational duties a week after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia. But on their return, 1 RMR refused to vacate the camp and 2 SIR had to be housed in tents at Farrer Park Sports Field. This was brought up in a speech by former Defence Minister Goh Keng Swee in Parliament, who said the issue was “symptomatic of a deeper malaise in the relations between the two governments on defence matters”.

These flashpoints of tension with Malaysia showed how Singapore had to confront the realities of being a new, small independent nation. Elsewhere in the region, another larger country also provided an even greater cause for concern.
