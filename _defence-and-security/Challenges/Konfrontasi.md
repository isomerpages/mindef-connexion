#### Konfrontasi

In the backdrop of Singaporeâ€™s tensions with Malaysia, the dominant power in the region, Indonesia, was carrying out Konfrontasi (Confrontation) against Singapore through sabotage and bombing. Between 1963 and 1966, there were at least 42 Konfrontasi-related attacks in Singapore.

The conflict was started by former Indonesian President Sukarno, who opposed the formation of the Federation of Malaysia consisting of Singapore, Malaysia, Sarawak and North Borneo (Sabah). One of the major incidents that happened during Konfrontasi was the MacDonald House bombing in Singapore on 10 March 1965, which killed three and injured 33.

When Singapore sentenced and hanged the two Indonesian marines responsible for the bombing, the decision was met by public anger in Jakarta, with the Singapore embassy ransacked.

It was only in August 1966 that Konfrontasi was put to an end when Indonesia signed a peace treaty with Malaysia. In September 1967, Singapore finally established formal diplomatic relations with Indonesia.
