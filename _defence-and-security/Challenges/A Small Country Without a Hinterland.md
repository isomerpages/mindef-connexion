## A Small Country Without a Hinterland

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
	“There are great trees, there are saplings, and there are creepers... The great trees are Russia, China, Western Europe, the United States, and Japan. Of the other nations, some are saplings that have the potential of becoming great trees, but the majority are creepers, which, because of lack of resources or lack of leadership, will never be great trees.” – Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in a conversation with Mr Richard Nixon in 1967 before the latter became US President.

Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was aware of Singapore’s vulnerabilities from the outset of Singapore’s independence. If Singapore were a sapling or creeper, we would have to be an exceptional one that could protect our sovereignty and national interests. 

He wrote in the second volume of his memoirs From Third World to First: “We faced tremendous odds with an improbable chance of survival. Singapore was not a natural country but man-made, a trading post the British had developed into a nodal point in their worldwide maritime empire.”

Singapore’s size is a perpetual vulnerability and a challenge that we have constantly sought to address since we became a sovereign and independent nation. This is because our small size leaves us with no strategic depth or hinterland to fall back on if we are attacked by foreign hostile forces.

The seizure of the SAF’s armoured vehicles in Hong Kong in 2016 led some to question whether this would have happened if Singapore were a big country.

	"We can never change the fact that we are a small country, but today, after 50 years of NS, we have built an SAF capable of defending Singapore.” –Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen at a commemoration of 50 years of National Service (NS) in 2017.

A strong defence also provides us with the political space and the freedom to act in our national and strategic interests. Should flashpoints in relationships with other countries arise, we stand on the firm ground provided by a strong SAF. 
In many ways, our determination to build a strong and credible defence force was forged by the events from the 1950s to 1970s.
