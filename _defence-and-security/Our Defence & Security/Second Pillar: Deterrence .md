The second pillar of Singapore’s defence is deterrence, which is contingent on a strong and capable SAF and a resilient populace, through the institutions of National Service (NS) and Total Defence (TD). 
	
Building robust deterrence means having to invest heavily in ensuring that our armed forces stay up to date with hardware and technology. But it also means having to constantly train our armed forces and equip them with the latest knowledge and skills to ward off potential aggressors. 
	
These efforts require significant investment and resources, both financial and manpower resources. Investments are made in human capital, operating and development expenditure for strong infrastructure and in new capabilities and research and development endeavours. The SAF also uses technology as a “force multiplier”, developing defence science for the country’s deterrence efforts.

	“We have to supplement SAF’s manpower with new technology, as manpower constraints will always be there. Our dependency should be more on technology than manpower. And we must develop ingeniously that technology edge.” – Dr Goh Keng Swee

However, the best technology has to be complemented by a determined fighting force, which in Singapore’s case, is a conscription army honed through the decades.
