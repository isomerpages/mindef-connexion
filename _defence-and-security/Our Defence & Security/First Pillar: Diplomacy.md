#### The First Pillar: Diplomacy

Singapore places great importance on the development of defence relations. Our defence diplomacy efforts help to improve mutual trust and understanding between Singapore and other countries, as well as enhance cooperative efforts to strengthen regional security, stability and peace. 
	
To this end, Singapore has been a firm advocate of building a robust, open and inclusive global security system that allows countries to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation. We focus on establishing strong and friendly ties through extensive interactions and cooperation with governments and defence forces worldwide. 
	
Singapore supports multilateral organisations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and the International Court of Justice. These organisations set guidelines and rules on how nations should interact with each other, and create a fair and transparent playing field for countries of different sizes to engage each other even in times of disagreement and conflict.
	
As part of this open and transparent approach, Singapore believes in building strong relationships and partnerships with countries across the world. We do this by hosting, participating, and supporting events with different countries. These help build familiarity, rapport and friendships between different countries, thereby raising trust and cooperation.

The ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM), established in 2006, is the highest defence consultative and cooperative mechanism in ASEAN. It aims to promote mutual trust and confidence through greater understanding of defence and security challenges as well as enhancement of transparency and openness. In 2010, ADMM-Plus was established, a platform for ASEAN and its eight Dialogue Partners, (namely, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the United States, collectively referred to as the “Plus Countries”) to strengthen security and defence cooperation for peace, stability and development. 

Another example is the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD), an annual dialogue that brings together defence ministers and military chiefs from various Asia-Pacific countries to exchange perspectives on the region’s most pressing security challenges. It is organised by the British think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), with support from the Singapore government. The dialogue gets its name from the location where it is held – Singapore’s Shangri-La Hotel. The event is a platform that allows countries to strengthen defence relations and help to build understanding and foster practical cooperation with one other.

As a responsible member of the international and regional community, Singapore also contributes to security efforts whenever we can.
