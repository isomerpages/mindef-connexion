## Building the Home Team
As Singapore’s early challenges showed, domestic turmoil can be as damaging and deadly as external ones. Communism and communalism were two salient threats to the nation’s internal security. 

The various security agencies, with the police, Internal Security Department and the SAF, had to cooperate and work together to counter these threats. Early on, there was a need for a coordinated response.

The Ministry of Home Affairs was set up in 1959 when Singapore attained self-governance. In 1965, when Singapore gained independence, the Ministry of Interior and Defence (MID) was formed. Its purview included the Police Force and Immigration Department.

In 1970, from MID, a separate ministry – Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) – was formed, and MID was renamed the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), with MHA tasked to deal with issues related to public safety, civil defence and immigration.

In the aftermath of the Laju incident in 1974, the Executive Group (EG), the first inter-agency coordination platform across the Public Service, was set up. It comprised senior officers from the security forces and various ministries and handled crises such as the 1986 Hotel New World Collapse. In 2004, the EG was reorganised to become the Homefront Crisis Executive Group (HCEG) to render more comprehensive crisis management capabilities.

For a more coordinated front on domestic security, the Home Team concept was launched in February 1997 by former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng. The Home Team Concept centres on the idea that agencies in the Home Team have many purposes but have one shared mission in keeping Singapore safe and secure. 

As of 2021, the Home Team comprises 11 agencies. The agencies are the Ministry of Home Affairs, Internal Security Department, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, Central Narcotics Bureau, Casino Regulatory Authority, Home Team Academy, Singapore Prison Service, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Police Force, Home Team Science & Technology Agency and Yellow Ribbon Singapore. 

The move to develop the Home Team was seen to be especially important as crises take on different forms over the years. Even as the communist threat diminished after the Cold War, the 2001 September 11 attacks, the Jemaah Islamiyah plot in Singapore as well as the 2016 attempted rocket attack on Marina Bay from Batam, posed new threats that required a joint response. Situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 also required a national response.

Amid evolving challenges, the Home Team is on a journey of constant transformation and strengthening of partnerships with the community to keep Singapore safe and secure. 

For example, the SCDF is introducing smart technology to transform its work. Future fire stations will use Internet of Things sensors to support operations by monitoring the status of equipment such as fuel and foam tank levels. The Home Team Science and Technology Agency, formed in 2019, helps to pioneer such projects.
