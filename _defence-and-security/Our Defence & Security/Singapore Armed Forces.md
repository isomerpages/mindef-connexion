#### Being Resourceful and Innovative 

#### 1st Generation SAF

In the early years of independence, Singapore was greatly short on resources to build a strong and capable defence force. The British withdrawal left a huge gap, especially in air and naval protection. A volunteer army would also not suffice due to Singapore’s lack of a soldiering tradition and a booming economy which drew people from a military career. The only way to overcome this while avoiding a large military expenditure was to develop a conscription army built around a small professional core model. Singapore’s first defence force in the 1960s was known as the 1st Generation SAF, whose most urgent focus was to provide for Singapore’s basic defence. The 1st Generation SAF had just two infantry battalions, two wooden ships and no air force.

#### 2nd Generation SAF

With Singapore’s constraints in natural resources and manpower, innovation has always been key to developing an effective defence force with maximum efficacy. From the early 1980s to late 1990s, SAF was continually upgraded and modernised in what was known as the 2nd Generation SAF. For instance, the RSAF acquired the AS-332 Super Puma helicopters in 1985, which became the mainstay of air support for army operations in troop lift and resupply, as well as Search and Rescue. The 2nd Generation SAF shifted to a concept of “Manoeuvre Warfare” capable of conducting forward defence and achieving a swift and decisive victory. 

#### 3rd Generation SAF

The September 11 attack in 2001 was a turning point as security threats morphed into less conventional ones. It was around this time that the SAF embarked on a 3rd Generation transformation journey. In 2004, the SAF further upgraded its capabilities, with the ability to fight as an integrated and networked force, and use precision warfare capabilities on the battlefield. It became a flexible force capable of a full spectrum of operations, including counter-terrorism operations. 

#### Next Generation SAF

Today, the Next Generation SAF is being developed to protect Singapore against an even wider range of threats and adapt to new operational demands. The pool of new enlistees is shrinking. By 2030, the male enlistee population is expected to decline by a third.

The Next Generation SAF will leverage new technologies to better sense-make information and execute robust responses. These include technologies such as the TPQ-53 Weapon Locating Radar (WLR), which will provide early detection and warning of hostile rockets, artillery and mortar threats. The weapon requires 30 per cent less manpower to operate compared with its predecessors.

Another development is the creation of Cyber Command - an integrated cyber command and cyber force that can operate, defend and protect our interests in the cyber domain. These advancements are made as cyber threats rapidly evolve and become increasingly sophisticated and destructive. 

On the home front, Singapore’s move to establish the cyber command has been an ongoing effort since the Defence Cyber Organisation was set up back in 2017. The cyber command arm has evolved to meet the challenges of the time. In February 2018, the Cyber NSF scheme was launched to tap the cyber talent pool in each enlistment cohort.

At the Committee of Supply (COS) debates in March 2021, Dr Ng introduced the Cybersecurity Task Force (CSTF) which had been set up to improve the SAF’s ability to monitor threats in the cyber domain, with NSmen serving in the CSTF. Such servicemen would be skilled through collaborations with academic institutions, while more cyber specialists would also be hired as part of the cyber defence effort.

The Next Generation SAF will also be using the latest technology to improve training for servicemen and women. This is crucial in circumstances such as the present COVID-19 pandemic where overseas training is not viable. An example of the use of this technology will be at SAFTI City, a training ground the size of 20 football fields, which will be built in western Singapore. With configurable buildings and road networks, as well as interactive targets that can “return” fire, soldiers will be able to improve training efficiency and standards through such simulators.
