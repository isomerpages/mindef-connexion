Singaporeâ€™s vulnerabilities and the constantly shifting security threat landscape meant that we often have to fine-tune how we best defend our interests. 

Our defence policy is fundamentally based on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy. This allows Singapore to enjoy security, peace and stability while protecting our sovereignty and territorial integrity. A strong defence also allows Singapore to act in our national interests without fear or favour.
