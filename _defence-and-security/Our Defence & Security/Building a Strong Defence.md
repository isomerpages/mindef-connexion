## Building a Strong Defence

Singapore’s vulnerabilities and the constantly shifting security threat landscape meant that we often have to fine-tune how we best defend our interests. 

Our defence policy is fundamentally based on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy. This allows Singapore to enjoy security, peace and stability while protecting our sovereignty and territorial integrity. A strong defence also allows Singapore to act in our national interests without fear or favour.

#### The First Pillar: Diplomacy

Singapore places great importance on the development of defence relations. Our defence diplomacy efforts help to improve mutual trust and understanding between Singapore and other countries, as well as enhance cooperative efforts to strengthen regional security, stability and peace. 
	
To this end, Singapore has been a firm advocate of building a robust, open and inclusive global security system that allows countries to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation. We focus on establishing strong and friendly ties through extensive interactions and cooperation with governments and defence forces worldwide. 
	
Singapore supports multilateral organisations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and the International Court of Justice. These organisations set guidelines and rules on how nations should interact with each other, and create a fair and transparent playing field for countries of different sizes to engage each other even in times of disagreement and conflict.
	
As part of this open and transparent approach, Singapore believes in building strong relationships and partnerships with countries across the world. We do this by hosting, participating, and supporting events with different countries. These help build familiarity, rapport and friendships between different countries, thereby raising trust and cooperation.

<p>
The ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM), established in 2006, is the highest defence consultative and cooperative mechanism in ASEAN. It aims to promote mutual trust and confidence through greater understanding of defence and security challenges as well as enhancement of transparency and openness. In 2010, ADMM-Plus was established, a platform for ASEAN and its eight Dialogue Partners, (namely, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia and the United States, collectively referred to as the “Plus Countries”) to strengthen security and defence cooperation for peace, stability and development. </p>
<p>
Another example is the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD), an annual dialogue that brings together defence ministers and military chiefs from various Asia-Pacific countries to exchange perspectives on the region’s most pressing security challenges. It is organised by the British think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), with support from the Singapore government. The dialogue gets its name from the location where it is held – Singapore’s Shangri-La Hotel. The event is a platform that allows countries to strengthen defence relations and help to build understanding and foster practical cooperation with one other. </p>

As a responsible member of the international and regional community, Singapore also contributes to security efforts whenever we can.

**Example: Maritime Security Efforts**
<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
	
<p>The Straits of Malacca and Singapore (SOMS) are critical and strategic waterways as about half of the global yearly seaborne trade and 70% of Asia’s oil imports pass through the SOMS. To ensure the security of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, the Malacca Straits Patrol initiative was launched in 2004 by Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. The measures include the Malacca Straits Sea Patrol, the “Eyes-in-the-Sky” (EiS) Combined Maritime Air Patrols and the Intelligence Exchange Group (IEG). Singapore works together with the other member countries to conduct regular patrols, and exchange information and intelligence to ensure the safety and security of the waterways. The cooperation was a success. In 2006, the Lloyd’s Joint War Risk Committee decided to drop the classification of the Malacca Strait as “a war-risk area”.</p>

<p>Internationally, Singapore also plays a part in ensuring the security of global waterways. In 2018, Singapore successfully completed its fifth command of the Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, as part of the international counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden (GoA). The 2018 deployment was also the SAF’s 11th deployment to the Gulf of Aden. Since 2009, Singapore has deployed more than 1340 sailors, soldiers and airmen, five ships and one maritime patrol aircraft, four SAF command teams, five task groups and one air detachment to support counter-piracy operations in the Gulf.</p>

**Example: Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) missions**
<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;"> <p>The RSN rendered assistance to Aceh in the aftermath of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. In the largest SAF overseas operation conducted so far, more than 1,500 SAF personnel and three Endurance Class landing ship tanks (LSTs) were deployed as part of the HADR efforts. In 2014, Singapore also assisted in the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, and Air Asia flight QZ8501 which crashed into the Java Sea in the same year. In 2021, the RSAF deployed a A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT) aircraft to Afghanistan to assist the evacuation of Afghanistan evacuees.</p>

#### Second Pillar: Deterrence 
The second pillar of Singapore’s defence is deterrence, which is contingent on a strong and capable SAF and a resilient populace, through the institutions of National Service (NS) and Total Defence (TD). 
	
Building robust deterrence means having to invest heavily in ensuring that our armed forces stay up to date with hardware and technology. But it also means having to constantly train our armed forces and equip them with the latest knowledge and skills to ward off potential aggressors. 
	
These efforts require significant investment and resources, both financial and manpower resources. Investments are made in human capital, operating and development expenditure for strong infrastructure and in new capabilities and research and development endeavours. The SAF also uses technology as a “force multiplier”, developing defence science for the country’s deterrence efforts. 

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
	“We have to supplement SAF’s manpower with new technology, as manpower constraints will always be there. Our dependency should be more on technology than manpower. And we must develop ingeniously that technology edge.” – Dr Goh Keng Swee

However, the best technology has to be complemented by a determined fighting force, which in Singapore’s case, is a conscription army honed through the decades.
