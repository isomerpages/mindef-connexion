In the face of evolving and sophisticated security threats, Singapore needs an all-round response where all Singaporeans have a part to play in keeping Singapore strong.

Unlike external threats, some threats are insidious and can be planted and spread unnoticed within the community. 

While the government has based its defence policy on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy, a resilient and vigilant citizenry also plays an important role in ensuring the safety and security of Singapore. 

In 1984, a new dimension to our defence called Total Defence was introduced. This is an approach that involves every Singaporean playing a part to build a strong and secure nation that is prepared to deal with any crisis.
