## Whole-of-Nation Approach

In the face of evolving and sophisticated security threats, Singapore needs an all-round response where all Singaporeans have a part to play in keeping Singapore strong.

Unlike external threats, some threats are insidious and can be planted and spread unnoticed within the community. 

While the government has based its defence policy on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy, a resilient and vigilant citizenry also plays an important role in ensuring the safety and security of Singapore. 

In 1984, a new dimension to our defence called Total Defence was introduced. This is an approach that involves every Singaporean playing a part to build a strong and secure nation that is prepared to deal with any crisis.

#### Total Defence 
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck Singapore in 2020, we came together to tackle it. Healthcare workers on the frontline tended to thousands stricken with the disease, economic agencies kept supply chains smooth for the nation’s survival, while security forces ensured law and order were preserved. 

The community also sprang into action. Businesses complied with restrictions and adapted for staff to work from home, while community groups came together to sew masks and help the vulnerable. 

The pandemic “reaffirmed that Total Defence is a living concept, vital and necessary to ensure our collective well-being and central to Singapore's ability to overcome grave challenges”, said Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen on 14 February 2021 in his Total Defence message.

Singapore faced a similar foe in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. The nation’s swift and excellent handling of the crisis saw plaudits from international organisations such as the World Health Organization. A national response, undergirded by the Total Defence concept, helped us overcome the crisis. 

Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was at the helm during the SARS situation and attributed the successful efforts to a cohesive nation. 

“All parts were working. Of course, when you have new developments and new crises, you may have to adapt here and there,” he said in the second volume of his memoirs, Standing Tall. The whole machine of government was all in good working order and continually serviced. That’s why this whole-of-country Total Defence approach worked.”

Besides government action, Singaporeans also demonstrated resilience and cohesion during the SARS crisis, showcasing the Total Defence mindset. Volunteers helped to conduct temperature checks at public events, while both individuals and organisations donated to help healthcare workers and SARS victims.

Singapore’s limited resources and size, in addition to the nature of today’s threats, require that our country has a Total Defence capability. This means that our defence involves not only the SAF but also the civilian population – every sector of society is mobilised and has a part to play in keeping Singapore secure. Citizens are organised to defend the country against all forms of attacks, whether military or non-military. 

The concept was introduced in 1984 as a national defence concept to rally all Singaporeans around the SAF should we face a conventional military threat. Over the years, Total Defence has become Singapore’s best defence and all-round response to the changing threats and challenges facing Singapore on all fronts. 

In 2019, a sixth pillar was added – Digital Defence, which is the ability to protect ourselves online so that we remain resilient and cohesive as a nation as we progress towards the digital future together. Every individual is at the frontline of Digital Defence and has a role to play.

Total Defence also revolves around the concept that while we aim to protect ourselves from aggressors, we also need to be prepared to bounce back when the attack has occurred. How do we respond when we are faced with devastation; how we rally around our neighbours and friends to offer help when the chips are down; how do we stand united in the face of adversity? Resilience is a trait that will define us as a nation when we are confronted with the sternest of tests.

“If Total Defence springs into action, as it did against COVID-19, then we can face the future, come what may, with optimism and hope. We can be assured that with Total Defence, not only can Singapore survive each crisis but will emerge stronger and with Singaporeans more united. This is the power of Total Defence.” – from Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen’s 2021 Total Defence Day Message.

Alongside the Total Defence concept is the SGSecure, a national movement to rally the community in the fight against terrorism.

#### SGSecure: Strengthening the Community to Fight Terrorism

The government continues to enhance our counter-terrorism capabilities but our community response is equally critical in our fight against terrorism. In 2006, the government started the Community Engagement Programme, or CEP, which began as an initiative to preserve and strengthen communal harmony and cohesion in the aftermath of a terror attack. Over time, the CEP expanded its objectives to also prepare our people to be resilient and better prepared for any crisis or emergency.

Building on the work of the CEP, the CEP was later revamped and expanded to become the SGSecure movement which was launched in 2016 to sensitise, train and mobilise the community in the fight against terror.

It focuses on three core actions: Staying Alert, Staying United and Staying Strong. SGSecure programmes have been introduced in our neighbourhoods, schools, workplaces and religious organisations to raise awareness of the terrorism threat and increase community vigilance. Emergency preparedness skills training were also made more easily accessible to improve community preparedness. Other programmes include activities that strengthen social cohesion, such as inter-faith activities. 

SGSecure has also roped in technology in the fight. The SGSecure app allows users to submit information on suspicious sightings and receive alerts and updates in the event of major emergencies. 

The SGSecure Responders’ Network was also launched in November 2019 to encourage members of the public to be active responders. Anyone can be a SGSecure Responder and members of the public can join easily through the SGSecure app. The “Respond” feature in the app allows Responders to be mobilised to help people in distress, such as by responding to cardiac arrest or minor fires around them.  

The Home Team also works closely with the community in other areas such as the Community Policing System which leverages technology and community partnerships as one of many ways to keep our neighbourhoods safe.

In the light of perpetual resource constraints and changing security challenges, Singapore has to continually adapt its approach to defence and homefront security. This means having a more coordinated response to emergencies, involving the population in defence and security as well as ensuring the strength of the defence force and security force. Innovation and technology will also keep Singapore at an advantage, while deterrence and diplomacy form a time-tested platform for our defence. 

These, coupled with the ability to adapt, innovate and stay resilient, will help secure the nation for decades to come.
