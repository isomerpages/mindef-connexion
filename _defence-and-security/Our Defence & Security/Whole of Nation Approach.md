## Whole-of-Nation Approach

In the face of evolving and sophisticated security threats, Singapore needs an all-round response where all Singaporeans have a part to play in keeping Singapore strong.

Unlike external threats, some threats are insidious and can be planted and spread unnoticed within the community. 

While the government has based its defence policy on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy, a resilient and vigilant citizenry also plays an important role in ensuring the safety and security of Singapore. 

In 1984, a new dimension to our defence called Total Defence was introduced. This is an approach that involves every Singaporean playing a part to build a strong and secure nation that is prepared to deal with any crisis.

#### Total Defence 
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck Singapore in 2020, we came together to tackle it. Healthcare workers on the frontline tended to thousands stricken with the disease, economic agencies kept supply chains smooth for the nation’s survival, while security forces ensured law and order were preserved. 

The community also sprang into action. Businesses complied with restrictions and adapted for staff to work from home, while community groups came together to sew masks and help the vulnerable. 

The pandemic “reaffirmed that Total Defence is a living concept, vital and necessary to ensure our collective well-being and central to Singapore's ability to overcome grave challenges”, said Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen on 14 February 2021 in his Total Defence message.

Singapore faced a similar foe in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. The nation’s swift and excellent handling of the crisis saw plaudits from international organisations such as the World Health Organization. A national response, undergirded by the Total Defence concept, helped us overcome the crisis. 

Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was at the helm during the SARS situation and attributed the successful efforts to a cohesive nation. 

“All parts were working. Of course, when you have new developments and new crises, you may have to adapt here and there,” he said in the second volume of his memoirs, Standing Tall. The whole machine of government was all in good working order and continually serviced. That’s why this whole-of-country Total Defence approach worked.”

Besides government action, Singaporeans also demonstrated resilience and cohesion during the SARS crisis, showcasing the Total Defence mindset. Volunteers helped to conduct temperature checks at public events, while both individuals and organisations donated to help healthcare workers and SARS victims.

Singapore’s limited resources and size, in addition to the nature of today’s threats, require that our country has a Total Defence capability. This means that our defence involves not only the SAF but also the civilian population – every sector of society is mobilised and has a part to play in keeping Singapore secure. Citizens are organised to defend the country against all forms of attacks, whether military or non-military. 

The concept was introduced in 1984 as a national defence concept to rally all Singaporeans around the SAF should we face a conventional military threat. Over the years, Total Defence has become Singapore’s best defence and all-round response to the changing threats and challenges facing Singapore on all fronts. 

In 2019, a sixth pillar was added – Digital Defence, which is the ability to protect ourselves online so that we remain resilient and cohesive as a nation as we progress towards the digital future together. Every individual is at the frontline of Digital Defence and has a role to play.

Total Defence also revolves around the concept that while we aim to protect ourselves from aggressors, we also need to be prepared to bounce back when the attack has occurred. How do we respond when we are faced with devastation; how we rally around our neighbours and friends to offer help when the chips are down; how do we stand united in the face of adversity? Resilience is a trait that will define us as a nation when we are confronted with the sternest of tests.

“If Total Defence springs into action, as it did against COVID-19, then we can face the future, come what may, with optimism and hope. We can be assured that with Total Defence, not only can Singapore survive each crisis but will emerge stronger and with Singaporeans more united. This is the power of Total Defence.” – from Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen’s 2021 Total Defence Day Message.

Alongside the Total Defence concept is the SGSecure, a national movement to rally the community in the fight against terrorism.
