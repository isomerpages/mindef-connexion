### Building a Strong Defence

Singapore’s vulnerabilities and the constantly shifting security landscape demand that we frequently fine-tune how we best defend our interests.

Our defence policy is based on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy. This allows Singapore to enjoy security, peace and stability while protecting our sovereignty, territorial integrity and way of life. A strong defence also allows Singapore to act in our national interests without being swayed by external pressures.

##### The First Pillar: Diplomacy

Singapore places great importance on the development of defence relations with other countries. Our defence diplomacy efforts enable us to improve mutual trust and understanding between Singapore and other countries, meet the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)'s training and defence technology needs, and facilitate multilateral efforts to strengthen regional security and stability.

Singapore has also been a strong advocate of upholding an open and inclusive regional security architecture that is underpinned by international law. Singapore supports multilateral platforms and international organisations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM), and the United Nations (UN). These organisations set guidelines and rules on how nations should interact with each other, and create a fair and transparent playing field for countries of different sizes to engage each other even in times of disagreement and conflict. These organisations also provide platforms for countries to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation to tackle transnational issues.

The ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM), established in 2006, is the highest-level defence consultative and cooperative mechanism in ASEAN. It aims to promote mutual trust and confidence through dialogue and practical cooperation. In 2010, the ADMM-Plus was established. The ADMM-Plus is the de facto regional security platform for ASEAN and eight of its Dialogue Partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, and the United States, collectively referred to as the “Plus Countries”) to strengthen security and defence cooperation for peace, stability and development through the ADMM-Plus Meetings and its Experts Working Groups.

Another example is the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD), an annual dialogue that brings together defence ministers and military chiefs from around the world to exchange perspectives on the region’s most pressing security challenges. It is organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), with support from the Singapore government. The dialogue gets its name from the location where it is held – the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore. The event is a platform that allows countries to strengthen defence relations, build understanding and foster practical cooperation with one other.
