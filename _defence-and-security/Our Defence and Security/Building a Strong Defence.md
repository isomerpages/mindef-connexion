### Building a Strong Defence

Singaporeâ€™s vulnerabilities and the constantly shifting security landscape demand that we frequently fine-tune how we best defend our interests.

Our defence policy is based on the twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy. This allows Singapore to enjoy security, peace and stability while protecting our sovereignty, territorial integrity and way of life. A strong defence also allows Singapore to act in our national interests without being swayed by external pressures.

##### The First Pillar: Diplomacy

Singapore places great importance on the development of defence relations with other countries. Our defence diplomacy efforts enable us to improve mutual trust and understanding between Singapore and other countries, meet the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)'s training and defence technology needs, and facilitate multilateral efforts to strengthen regional security and stability.

Singapore has also been a strong advocate of upholding an open and inclusive regional security architecture that is underpinned by international law. Singapore supports multilateral platforms and international organisations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM), and the United Nations (UN). These organisations set guidelines and rules on how nations should interact with each other, and create a fair and transparent playing field for countries of different sizes to engage each other even in times of disagreement and conflict. These organisations also provide platforms for countries to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation to tackle transnational issues.
