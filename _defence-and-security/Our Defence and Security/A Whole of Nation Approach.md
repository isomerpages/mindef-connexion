### A Whole-of-Nation Approach

In the face of evolving and increasingly sophisticated security threats, Singapore must not only have a strong defence force and Home Team, but also ensure that its community plays its part in keeping Singapore safe and secure. For instance, if and when Singapore faces terrorism threats, external diplomatic or economic pressures or supply chain difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, a Whole-of-Society response, in the form of Total Defence, will enable us to remain united and overcome the crises together.
	
#### Total Defence 
	
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck Singapore in 2020, we came together to tackle it. Healthcare workers on the frontline tended to thousands stricken with the disease, economic agencies kept supply chains smooth for the nation’s survival, while security forces ensured law and order on the sea lines of communication to prevent further disruptions to the supply chains. 
	
The community also sprang into action. Businesses complied with restrictions and adapted for staff to work from home, while community groups came together to sew masks and help the vulnerable. 
	
The pandemic “reaffirmed that Total Defence is a living concept, vital and necessary to ensure our collective well-being and central to Singapore's ability to overcome grave challenges”, said Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen on 14 February 2021 in his Total Defence message.

Singapore faced a similar challenge when coping with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. The nation’s swift and excellent handling of the crisis received plaudits from international organisations such as the World Health Organization. A national response, undergirded by the Total Defence concept, helped us overcome the crisis. 

Former Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong was at the helm during the SARS situation and attributed the successful efforts to a cohesive nation. 
	
“All parts were working. Of course, when you have new developments and new crises, you may have to adapt here and there,” he said in the second volume of his memoirs, Standing Tall. “The whole machine of government was all in good working order and continually serviced. That’s why this whole-of-country Total Defence approach worked.”
	
Besides government action, Singaporeans also demonstrated resilience and cohesion during the SARS crisis, showcasing the Total Defence mind-set. Volunteers helped to conduct temperature checks at public events, while both individuals and organisations donated to help healthcare workers and SARS victims.
	
Singapore’s limited resources and size, in addition to the nature of today’s threats, require that our country has a Total Defence capability. This means that our defence involves not only the SAF but also the civilian population – every sector of society is mobilised and has a part to play in keeping Singapore secure. Citizens are organised to defend the country against all forms of attacks, whether military or non-military.
