#### Hostile Information Campaigns 
A non-conventional threat that has grown in the digital age is the emergence of hostile information campaigns (HICs). In HICs, hostile foreign actors seek to manipulate political discourse and harm a country’s interest by carrying out coordinated and sophisticated online communications activities to manipulate public opinion. The Internet’s anonymity and the prevalent use of social media give hostile actors a vast and easily accessible playing field.

HICs can be part of an overall hybrid threat, one which combines various attacks on a target. For instance, a country can embark on a “hack-and-leak” operation, mounting cyberattacks with a view to obtaining information that can be used to undermine trust in the target’s official institutions. 

As Singapore works towards being a Smart Nation, digital technology will pervade all aspects of our lives. While the digital revolution presents opportunities for Singapore, it also makes us vulnerable to threats from the digital domain. Singapore’s size, hyper-connectivity and multi-ethnic and multi-religious society further make us a target.

During a period of tension with another country between 2016 and 2017, Singapore experienced the following, which attempted to undermine our foreign policy position. Online commentaries and videos were uploaded by social media accounts, which had lain dormant for many years. Many of these were in Mandarin and targeted at our Chinese-speaking population. These contents were also widely circulated via chat applications and aimed to influence sentiments among Singaporeans.

During a period of bilateral tension with a country in 2018, we saw a large spike in online comments critical of Singapore, and many came from anonymous accounts. They sought to give an artificial impression of widespread objection to Singapore’s position.
