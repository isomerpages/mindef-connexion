#### A New Global and Regional Security Landscape

Geopolitics has constantly evolved over the years. From the early 1960s to the late 1980s, it was defined by two superpowers, the USA and the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, the US stood as the single superpower in an era that political scientists call the unipolar world.

Today, international politics is less clear. The US remains a powerful nation but China is also emerging as a rising power. While this is not quite the Cold War of the 1960s and 1970s, the dynamics between the two behemoths have created tensions among many countries, with pressure for smaller countries to take sides. Trade embargoes and contestations between the US and China in areas such as the South China Sea have complicated matters.

Such developments present a conundrum for us. “We have no desire to take sides or to be caught in the crossfire, we stand for our national interests, and so far, we have maintained independence and space for ourselves. But as contestation increases in this region, it will be increasingly difficult to do so,” said Dr Ng in 2020.

The hope, according to Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, is for peaceful coexistence. “Ultimately, we would like to see the two biggest economies in the world coexist peacefully, and in an open and inclusive regional architecture throughout ASEAN, and this will be win-win for all of us,” he said in September 2021.

In the region, countries such as Japan, India and Australia are also taking bigger roles as the Asia-Pacific region becomes more militarised and contested. Military spending in Asia has grown more than 50 per cent in the past decade. Meanwhile, ASEAN members have doubled defence spending in the last 15 years.

Even with Singapore building one of the most advanced militaries in the world, and countries in the region developing warmer relations through bilateral and multilateral collaborations via platforms such as ASEAN, there are still occasional reminders that we should not be complacent. 

An example would be occasional disputes arising from incursions by neighbours into Singapore Territorial Waters or the nation’s airspace. Singapore has labelled such incidents as “provocative and escalatory”, adding that they increase tensions and real risks, harming bilateral ties.

<p>In October 2018, Malaysia unilaterally extended the Johor Baru Port Limits, encroaching into Singapore Territorial Waters off Tuas. Singapore lodged a strong protest with the Malaysian government. During this period, there were daily intrusions by Malaysian government vessels into Singapore waters. </p>

<p>On 6 December 2018, the Government extended port limits off Tuas. The RSN’s patrol operations were challenging as it had to defend Singapore’s sovereignty and yet show considerable restraint to avoid potentially escalating the situation. </p>
	
<p>After months of negotiation, on 8 April 2019, both countries suspended their overlapping port limit claims and implemented their port limits in effect prior to 25 October 2018 and 6 December 2018. </p>

Singapore remains committed to our strategic interests, backed by a strong SAF armed with a mandate to protect our country’s sovereignty. However, we also look out for the region’s interests, being neighbours by geography and partners by choice. Singapore’s approach to our neighbours and like-minded partners is based on sovereign equals and mutual respect. We share common interests and work together on issues to progress together. 

As the threat landscape continues to evolve, new and complex security challenges such as transnational terrorism, disinformation campaigns have emerged which can in fact be more difficult to spot and manage than conventional threats.
