<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">“There is a familiar dictum in military annals, that a cardinal mistake, which has led to failures, has been to prepare for the next battle, based on the last war.” – Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen at the Ministry of Defence Committee of Supply Debate 2020.</div>

Through the years, threats to Singapore have ranged from riots, terrorist incidents to cyber attacks and maritime disputes. As challenges to Singapore’s defence and security continue to evolve and change, we must also keep tweaking our approach to ensure we are prepared for all manners of threats. 

Yet, even as today’s SAF stands far more advanced and capable than the early days, some of our vulnerabilities remain the same in the present era. For example, the immutable characteristic of being a small country without the backing of a hinterland with abundant resources. This means that in the world of international politics, Singapore is a price-taker and not price-setter.

Even as we have to contend with new shifting geopolitics, new threats are emerging with the advent of modern communications technology.
