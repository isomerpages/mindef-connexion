#### Global Incidents 

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
“Without a strong defence, our air and shipping routes in and out of Singapore could easily be blocked – as Qatar now faces. These are not imaginary security threats that our national servicemen train for but real – they have happened elsewhere and can occur to Singapore too.” – Dr Ng Eng Hen on 11 February 2019 during a Parliamentary sitting.

Singapore only has to take a look at recent events to see how other countries, especially small states, can have their interests subjugated. A strong defence force allows Singapore to act on our national priorities while deterring other countries from aggressive acts against us.

For example, Singapore and Qatar, a state on the west coast of the Persian Gulf, share a few things in common. Both have overcome their limited land size to become globally recognised as trade hubs, despite regional pressure. 

On 5 June 2017, Qatar’s neighbours, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt unexpectedly severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, over its alleged support for terrorism, and close ties with Iran. The embargo cut off major regional trade routes to Qatar for 43 months, and the country had to rapidly restructure trade routes and create new supply chains.

The matter was discussed in Singapore’s Parliament, with Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen bringing up the point that without National Service and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), the same could happen to Singapore – its interests might be disregarded by its neighbours. There have been other unilateral movements made against smaller countries as well. 

After the Cold War ended, when the Berlin Wall came down, Lithuania and other Baltic states believed it was time to reap the “peace dividend” and abolished their military conscription. Less than two decades after the end of the Cold War came the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, sparking fear in Lithuania that the same could happen to Lithuania. This was a lesson that one can never take self-defence for granted. 

In 1990, Kuwait was invaded by Iraq as it did not have a military adequate enough to defend itself. The United States and other allies had to push Iraqi forces out, and Singapore contributed to Kuwait’s post-conflict stabilisation. There have been other examples as well, such as the annexation of Crimea. 
Hence, as a small country, we cannot depend on others to rescue us if we are in a similar predicament. While we seek to be friends with all, we are ultimately alone in the responsibility to defend our country.
