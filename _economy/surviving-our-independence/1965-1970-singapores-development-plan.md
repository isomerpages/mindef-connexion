The exit from Malaysia thrust Singapore into the open. Without a hinterland nor natural resources, the challenges facing the new nation were immense. Labour unrest continued to fester while unemployment remained high. The only solution was to press on with the plan to rapidly industrialise the economy.

Without Malaysia’s large market, Singapore’s leaders had to think out of the box. Instead of focusing on the domestic market, our leaders switched to an export-oriented strategy. Labour-intensive industries were created to soak up unemployment while pushing ahead with the building of infrastructure to serve the industries.

Singapore’s plans were, however, disrupted by a shock announcement. Just two years after independence, in 1967, the British announced that it would withdraw its forces from Singapore, dealing a huge blow to the newly independent nation. Not only would the withdrawal compromise the defence of Singapore’s sovereignty, it would also deeply impact Singapore’s economy.

The British withdrawal meant that Singapore had to accelerate its plans for an export-led industralisation strategy. This required Singapore to open our borders to foreign investors, a course of action that seemed to go against conventional wisdom at the time. While some newly independent nations were moving to eject foreign corporations from their borders, slashing imports and manufacturing their own products for the domestic market, this only worked because they had a large domestic market that Singapore did not have.

#### Gaining a Foothold in the Global Market

To survive, Singapore had to tap on the global market. As then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee explained:

The economic rationale behind the courting of foreign investors was twofold:

1. First, large foreign companies targeted the global market, had the necessary expertise and networks that would allow Singapore to quickly scale up these industries. They also had the financial capital to invest in Singapore’s infrastructure. For instance, oil company Shell built Singapore’s first oil refinery at the cost of $30 million on Pulau Bukom in 1961.

2. Second, the goal was to eventually enable knowledge transfer from foreign companies to local enterprises. This would enable local companies to, in the long run, also acquire the necessary technical expertise to start building local industries.
