## Surviving Our Independence

In 1959, Singapore achieved self-governance after years of struggle. The People’s Action Party (PAP) was voted into power in the Legislative Assembly general election, becoming the first full elected government of the self-governing state of Singapore on 5 June 1959. Mr Lee Kuan Yew was appointed the first Prime Minister.

The new government faced huge problems almost immediately. While Singapore had recovered from the devastation of World War II, the country was hardly in fit shape: the city centre was overcrowded, buildings were deteriorating, and nearly 70 per cent of the population lived in slums. Moreover, the economy was largely trade-based. As there was hardly any local industry to create meaningful jobs for a growing population, unemployment rate was in the double digits.

The economy became a key priority for the new government. The founding leaders of Singapore had in place two key economic strategies. One, rapid industrialisation, and two, merger with Malaysia.

#### 1961: A Plan for Rapid Industralisation

In 1961, a team of United Nations (UN) economists led by Dutch industrialist Albert Winsemius visited Singapore to advise the new government how to develop its economy. They issued a report, “A Proposed Industrialisation Programme for the State of Singapore”, which outlined a plan to embark Singapore on a path of rapid industralisation to absorb the large numbers of unemployed workers.

They recommended that in order to end unemployment, over 200,000 jobs had to be created within 10 years. Until that time, the local economy was dominated by trading firms and entrepot trade. While trade formed the basis of Singapore’s prosperity during the colonial period, it left Singapore’s economy particularly vulnerable to the global prices of tin and rubber. Furthermore, entrepot trade was not able to generate enough jobs to absorb the rising numbers of unemployed workers.

The lead agency tasked to undertake the critical role of implementing the industrialisation plan was the Economic Development Board (EDB), which was set up in 1961. Taking over from the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board, which was founded in 1957, EDB had a much larger remit and capital base. It was armed with $100 million over the period of 1961 to 1964 to drive industrialisation in Singapore. Its first task was to build the necessary infrastructure to support the plan.

One of its first tasks was to develop Jurong into an industrial estate, as part of a push to create labour-intensive industries that would generate jobs for the people. Some of the early factories produced items such as garments, toys and wigs. This was only the beginning of the story of Jurong.

#### 1963: Merger with Malaysia

The economic rationale for a merger with Malaysia was clear. A combined market of about 12 million people was big enough to immediately overcome the limitations of Singapore’s small market size by enabling the growth of local firms, and generating jobs and income for Singaporeans.

However, this was complicated on several fronts.

First, the strong presence of communism throughout the 1960s engendered a high level of industrial unrest in Singapore.

<p>In 1961, the left-wing arm of the ruling People’s Action Party broke off to form the Barisan Sosialis, whose objective was to topple the government. As part of their strategy, the communists instigated workers to wreak havoc on the economy. From 1963 to 1968, Singapore lost some 35,000 to 45,000 man-hours each year to strikes. </p>
</div>
 
 This was severely disruptive to the economy, making Singapore unattractive to foreign investors. “The running joke was that a factory would be set up on Monday and all sorts of banners screaming ‘Exploitation of Workers’ would be hung up by Friday,” shared Mr I.F. Tang, who was part of the UN team of experts.

Furthermore, in 1963, the newly formed Federation of Malaya came under Indonesia’s attack. Back then, Indonesia believed that the Federation was created to contain its influence in the region. As such, it embarked on [Konfrontasi](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/126b6b07-f796-4b4c-b658-938001e3213e), a low-intensity confrontation between Indonesia and the Federation.

<p>Led by President Sukarno, Indonesia carried out acts of subversion and sabotage, including bombings, to destabilise the Federation between 1963 and 1966. </p>
	
<p>Moreover, it cut trade ties with the Federation, hoping to disrupt its trade and cripple its economy. As a result, Singapore’s trade with Indonesia shrank. Imports fell by 23 per cent while exports declined 31 per cent in 1964 compared with 1963. </p>
	
<p>The Indonesians also carried out a series of bombing attempts in Singapore, both to directly cause damage to Singapore as well as rattle foreign investors. On 16th November 1964, an attempt by 10 Indonesian commandos to sabotage an oil installation was foiled. The next year, in 1965, the tragic bombing of Macdonald House along Orchard Road claimed the lives of three, while injuring another 33.</p>

In addition, the union with Malaysia was also troubled from the start.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">

<p>Both sets of leaders – Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman and Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew – fundamentally disagreed on what kind of society they wanted. Mr Lee was insistent on a society where all races were treated equally but the Tunku believed in the primacy of the Malays in Malaysia. Tensions boiled over to the streets as racial violence exploded across the Federation. </p>

<p>On the economic front, the anticipated benefits from the merger did not quite pan out the way it was initially envisioned. The increase of the manufacturing share of real GDP was modest – from 16.9 percent in 1960 to 19.1 percent in 1965. Real GDP grew at an annual compound rate of 5.7 percent during this period. Some 21,000 jobs were created in manufacturing, but the unemployment percentage still hovered in the double digits. This persuaded Dr Goh that the benefits of the common market were not as substantial as he once believed.</p>
</div>

The political, social and economic difficulties of the merger led to a momentous decision, one that defined Singapore’s story. Cast out of Malaysia on 9th August, 1965, Singapore was on its own – it no longer had a common market of 12 million consumers to support its growth. With no natural resources, a tiny population and rising unemployment, Singapore’s leaders were faced with a dire situation.
