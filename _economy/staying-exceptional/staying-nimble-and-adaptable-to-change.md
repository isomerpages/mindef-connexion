The government has played a central role in building and growing the economy.

In its 2017 report, the Committee on the Future Economy stressed that it cannot tell the future, but it knows what Singapore will need to succeed:

For instance, the government has been testing autonomous vehicles in parts of Singapore, with the aim of rolling them out for public use.

It is with the knowledge of this past that we can be confident of the future. The world will continue to evolve, and change will continue to accelerate. For this, we must prepare for a world that is vastly different from what it is today.
