Tripartism remains important to Singapore’s success. Harmonious relations were the bedrock on which Singapore’s early industrialisation efforts were based. While industrial disruption is no longer an issue, technological disruption has brought about new and complex challenges.

Tackling such difficult issues, including how to provide for the retirement adequacy of gig economy workers and ensuring Singaporeans remain employable in the midst of an AI and robotics revolution, requires workers, employers and the government to work well together.

But there are threats to this strong bond of trust built up over decades of working together. Digital disruption could lead workers to distrust the rise of technology, especially if it threatens their jobs. This could lead to a breakdown of trust between employees and companies, leading to friction and the loss of the powerful tripartite relationship.

Strengthening this bond remains a critical strategy for Singapore. A strong tripartite bond is resilient to shocks that could threaten Singapore’s economic and social fabric.
