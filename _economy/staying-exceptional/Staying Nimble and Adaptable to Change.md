The government has played a central role in building and growing the economy.

In its 2017 report, the Committee on the Future Economy stressed that it cannot tell the future, but it knows what Singapore will need to succeed:

This approach is making a difference.

For instance, the government has been testing autonomous vehicles in parts of Singapore, with the aim of rolling them out for public use.

Another example is agriculture. The introduction of new technology in agri-technology such as tower farming and the use of AI-controlled environmental lighting have helped push new frontiers in the sector.

Today’s global economy is marked by accelerating pace of change, with shorter business cycles and rapid digital disruption. This makes it imperative for Singapore, being a small and open economy, to continuously reinvent itself to keep up with the environment.

Companies in Singapore face both opportunities and challenges in the new digital economy. E-commerce, for instance, opens up new markets while slashing costs for both big and small companies.

To help companies transform, Singapore has rolled out Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for 23 sectors covering 80 per cent of the economy.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>ITMs aim to transform companies at a sectoral level. These maps are modelled on each industry’s specific needs, targeting companies which need help to transform in order to meet the needs of the new economy. </p>

<p>For instance, manufacturing companies that use robotics or automation can seek grants from the government. These technologies may be too expensive for small companies to acquire but grants are aimed at helping companies adopt technological solutions to boost productivity and achieve scale. </p>

<p>Business associations are partnering the government and the unions to carry out the work the ITMs rolled out so far. </p>

**Conclusion**

In the 2011 book Hard Truths, founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew was asked what it will take for Singapore to survive, given the rising challenges that Singapore face.

His advice was simple, clear and straightforward:

Indeed, the story of Singapore’s journey from third world to first was a journey marked by sacrifice, determination and willpower. It is a story about how a people built something from nothing; how a nation’s fate that was determined by guts and gumption; and how the will of a people determined to survive managed to succeed against the odds.

It is with the knowledge of this past that we can be confident of the future. The world will continue to evolve, and change will continue to accelerate. For this, we must prepare for a world that is vastly different from what it is today.
