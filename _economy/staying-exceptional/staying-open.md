As Singapore is a small and open economy, we must keep championing and pushing for free trade and access to open markets.

To this end, we will continue to look for like-minded partners who also believe in the need for free trade whether in goods, services or even digital trade.

We are pushing for regional cooperation across multiple platforms, from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to the Asean Economic Community. These agreements will help to ensure that we continue to have access to overseas markets, a factor that is critical to Singaporeâ€™s survival.

Apart from building international linkages, we have been forging closer ties within the region. ASEAN remains an important market for us, given our strong ties with our neighbours and the rest of the ASEAN countries.
