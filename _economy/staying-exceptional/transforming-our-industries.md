Today’s global economy is marked by accelerating pace of change, with shorter business cycles and rapid digital disruption. This makes it imperative for Singapore, being a small and open economy, to continuously reinvent itself to keep up with the environment.

Companies in Singapore face both opportunities and challenges in the new digital economy. E-commerce, for instance, opens up new markets while slashing costs for both big and small companies.

To help companies transform, Singapore has rolled out Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for 23 sectors covering 80 per cent of the economy.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>ITMs aim to transform companies at a sectoral level. These maps are modelled on each industry’s specific needs, targeting companies which need help to transform in order to meet the needs of the new economy. </p>

<p>For instance, manufacturing companies that use robotics or automation can seek grants from the government. These technologies may be too expensive for small companies to acquire but grants are aimed at helping companies adopt technological solutions to boost productivity and achieve scale. </p>

<p>Business associations are partnering the government and the unions to carry out the work the ITMs rolled out so far. </p>
