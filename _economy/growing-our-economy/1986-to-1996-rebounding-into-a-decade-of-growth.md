#### 1986 to 1996: Rebounding into a Decade of Growth

The 1985 recession was a painful but important reminder that Singapore could not afford to stand still. Moreover, the growth we saw prior to the recession had started to flag due to resource constraints and diminishing returns on investment. 

Change was necessary. But could Singapore restructure the economy in order to capture new opportunities, and stay ahead of the competition from other fast-industrialising economies, including Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan?

We took on new directions and created different engines of growth. For one, Singapore diversified our economy by developing multiple areas of growth. We also expanded our presence overseas. These efforts fortified resilience in the economy and created buffers to mitigate future downturns.

We took on the challenge and emerged stronger than before.

**Growing the Financial Sector**

One key niche area that had become increasingly important to Singapore was its financial sector.

While local banks such as OCBC, UOB and OUB have been stalwarts, their main business prior to independence was supporting Chinese merchants and traders. Once industralisation took off, however, these banks, including DBS, became full commercial banks that financed a wider array of financial activities.

In the late 1960s, the development of the Asian Dollar Market helped establish Singapore as a leading foreign exchange market after London New York and Tokyo.

By the 1980s, financial services had become one of the biggest drivers of economic growth. In 1983, for instance, the financial sector alone accounted for about 30 percent of overall GDP growth.

The 1980s and 1990s also saw Singapore intensify efforts to develop fee-based financial activities such as fund management, stock trading activities and insurance.

**Growing the Tourism Sector**

Another area that was given much focus in the 1980s was tourism – in 1981, the government identified the tourism industry as one of the pillars of growth in its 10-year economic development plan. In 1984, a tourism task force headed by then Minister of State for Trade and Industry Wong Kwei Cheong was convened to look at revitalising and promoting Singapore as a major tourist destination.

The task force recommended developing new tourism attractions such as a new indoor stadium that could host concerts and conventions. It also called for the government to preserve historical areas such as Chinatown, places full of rich historical and cultural tradition.

**Strengthening the Manufacturing Sector**

At the same time, The government also continued the multi-year drive to upgrade our industries and move up the value chain.

In manufacturing, we moved to further deepen our expertise in high-value manufacturing including production, testing and assembly.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>For instance, we built on Singapore’s expertise in electronics and precision engineering. This helped Singapore benefit greatly from the growth of personal computing. </p>

<p>From 1986 to 1996, Singapore produced about 45 to 50 percent of the world’s hard disks, making Singapore a critical global node for hard-disc drives. </p>
</div>

Moreover, to ensure that we did not become over-reliant on electronics, we also diversified within the manufacturing sector.

The government embarked on an ambitious plan to develop a petrochemicals facility that would entrench Singapore as a global petrochemicals hub. Jurong Island is a man-made island that combined the best of Singapore – forward thinking, a dare-to-do-and-dream attitude as well as the ability to deliver the final product.

**Developing an External Wing**

Up till the 1990s, the focus had been to bring in foreign investment to build up Singapore’s economy. Outward investment from Singapore to overseas market was not a key concern. It was clear, however, it should not remain that way.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>The 1986 Economic Committee Report noted that investment returns within the country started to face diminishing returns. Moving some investment overseas to growing economies would bring in better returns. </p>

<p>It also suggested that Singapore could make more use of its accumulated experience in building and operating airports and sea ports, as well as urban planning to help other industrialising countries develop. In this way, Singapore could start to move exports beyond goods and into services.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was also a need to groom Singapore’s own crop of home-grown companies. These companies would anchor and base their operations in Singapore and expand overseas in regional markets to develop scale and market share.  </p>

<p>These considerations led the government to embark on a concerted push to develop an external wing of its economy.  </p>
</div>

This period saw huge investments from Singapore flow into China and neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. In China, we started our first government-to-government project, the Suzhou Industrial Park, and later Tianjin Eco-City. In Indonesia, Singapore companies helped to set up Batamindo Industrial Park and the Bintan Industrial Estate.

As Singapore expanded its export of goods and services, we became increasingly dependent on free trade. There is a need to ensure that we have access to open markets. As such, we have always supported an open, rules-based multilateral system that promotes a stable and predictable international trading environment such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

Keeping free trade flowing to Singapore was a key reason behind the drive to develop a network of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the first of which – the ASEAN Free Trade Area – was inked in 1992.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>As at 2020, Singapore has 23 FTAs, ranging from bilateral agreements with economies such as Japan, Costa Rica, China and the United States, to regional pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership and Singapore-European Free Trade Association FTA. </p>

<p>The primary goal of such FTAs is to “expand Singapore’s economic space”, wrote Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh in 2019.</p>

<p>“The strategy was to link our small economy to the economies of other bigger countries. In this way, Singapore will be more deeply connected to the global supply chain and our exporters will have lower tariff or non-tariff barriers.”</p>

<p>These FTAs enable Singapore’s exporters, which include foreign manufacturers based here, to enjoy preferential rates in key export markets such as China, Japan and the US. This gives Singapore an edge over other lower-cost locations and is another reason foreign MNCs are keen to invest in Singapore.</p>

Between 1986 and 1996, Singapore grew at an average of 12.8 per cent a year, launching Singapore into a group of fast-growing nations that analysts termed Asian Tigers. Singapore alongside Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong, were hailed for their remarkable growth over the decade.

One key success factor that the ability to constantly make Singapore relevant to the global economy. Without a large domestic market or natural resources, there is no real need for large companies to invest in us. Neither would large countries want to trade with a tiny island that had little to offer in return.
