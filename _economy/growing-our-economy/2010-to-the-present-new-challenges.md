#### 2010 to the Present: New Challenges

The challenges Singapore has and continues to face since 2010 are manifold: some are structural in nature while others require shorter-term tactics.

Here are some of the present challenges and how we will be going about tackling them in the years ahead.

**A Mature Phase of Growth**

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/economy/growing-our-economy/Screenshot%202020-10-19%20at%201.png)

By 2011, it was clear that Singapore had entered the next phase of its economic development: the mature stage. It would be difficult for us to grow at previous rates and growing at between 3 percent and 5 percent a year would a good result.

One reason for this is simply our finite resources: as a small country, we have limited land and people. While we were able to circumvent our physical limits through innovations such as the Jurong Rock Caverns, the reality is that we cannot expect to keep growing at the same pace.

**Ageing Population**

Apart from having to deal with the geographical limitations and small population, our ageing population is one of the most daunting challenges that Singapore faces.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>The life expectancy in Singapore has risen to 83.2 years, in 2018 from 76.1 years in 1990. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. Likewise, between 2011 and 2030, the median age of the citizen population will rise from 39 years to 47 years.</p>

<p>Efforts to boost the natural rate of population growth has had little success - total fertility rate stood at just 1.14 per Singaporean woman in 2018, much lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.</p>
</div>

The ageing population will have a significant impact on Singapore’s economy in the long term.

As older workers leave the workforce without a sufficient pool of younger workers to replace them, the economy could also start to lose its dynamism and vibrancy. Talent is a critical component for companies in the knowledge-based economy but with a shrinking workforce, companies could struggle to find the talent they need here. This would make Singapore far less attractive than its neighbours, which have younger population bases.

The ageing workforce also puts strains on other parts of the Singapore economy, especially its fiscal position. Income tax collections could start to decline with a smaller workforce, which would then constrain the government’s ability to spend. At the same time, there will be a need to raise social spending. In fact, social spending has already doubled from $15 billion in 2009 to $30 billion in 2018, with further rises expected as the population continues to age.

<b>Rise in Populism and Anti-Trade/Globalisation Forces </b>

When Britain first voted to leave the European Union in 2016, many analysts thought it was a one-off event that concerned only the British. What many did not expect was that is was the start of a surge in populism around the world.

The rise of populism goes beyond simply embracing nationalism; nativist tendencies result in the wholesale rejection of globalisation and all that open borders bring.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>One of the biggest fallouts from this trend has been the ongoing US-China trade tensions. In 2018 and 2019, the world’s two largest economies started to levy tariffs worth hundreds of billions of dollars on each other. That in turn has severely affected the global trade and economy. </p>

<p>The rising tensions have also spilled over into the technological arena, with the US banning American companies from using technology from Chinese company Huawei. The US and China signed a pact to ease trade tensions in early 2020 but the episode serves as an important reminder of how quickly a shift in the external environment can hit Singapore hard.</p>
</div>

The rise of protectionism results in the reduction of trade, which affects Singapore’s livelihood directly. Should trade barriers go up, Singapore’s exports will start to get more expensive and less competitive. A secondary impact is through slower growth rates for both countries. A reduction in trade is likely to lead to slower growth. This, in turn, will likely lead to falling demand for Singapore’s exports.

The longer-term impact of rising populism is on the fate of multilateral organisations such as the UN, WTO and the International Monetary Fund – will they stay relevant?

For instance, the US has already pulled out of the Paris Agreement unilaterally, threatening to overturn progress made so far in the landmark climate change pact. Likewise, the WTO, which is the primary forum for countries to resolve trade conflicts, has been under siege.

This puts Singapore in a difficult spot, since small countries typically rely on such organisations and international law to resolve conflicts with larger powers.

As PM Lee said, multilateral organisations such as the UN and WTO are critical to Singapore’s survival:

**Digital Disruption: A Source of Challenges and Opportunities**

Digital technology has reshaped the way we work, live and play. Whether it is Facebook and how it is changed our social circle, or how Grab has redefined the taxi industry, technological disruption is on the rise.

The advent of technologies such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing and robotics is revolutionising manufacturing, while big data has given companies new ways to understand their consumers. This in turn is quickly changing the rules of the game for companies. If they are armed with the right idea, capital and networks, small companies can quickly scale up to displace large and slower incumbents.

This offers a range of new challenges and opportunities for Singapore for Singapore.

On the one hand, digital technologies have the potential to make quantum leaps on productivity, generating billions in additional economic value. However, digital disruption, if not managed well, could lead to social issues.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>For instance, the rise of robots has led some to believe that there could be huge job losses. Large companies which employ thousands of people could find themselves disrupted quickly if they do not move fast enough.  </p>

<p>Workers could also find themselves out of a job if they hold on to obsolete skills. New types of workers, including those from the gig economy have risen. </p>
</div>

The challenge for governments around the world, including Singapore, is managing these challenges while positioning the economy to benefit from these forms of digital disruption.

**New Competition from Regional Rivals**

Singapore remains one of the top destinations for investment largely because it has kept its status as a key transport, financial, maritime and technology hub. However, major cities around the region are challenging Singapore in various fields.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are aiming to be the regional hubs for air travel. The governments of both countries have spent massively to upgrade existing airport infrastructure. This is partly why we have had to be forward-looking in order to stay ahead of the competition.  </p>

<p>China’s Belt and Road Initiative will see billions of dollars being poured into the region to build infrastructure, from roads to ports. While stronger connectivity helps keep lines of communication open, some of these ports and airports could rise to become our competitors along the way.</p>
</div>

Likewise on the financial front, Singapore may have a significant lead over neighbouring countries as a financial hub but competition is quickly hotting up.

The Singapore Exchange has seen trading volumes – an indicator of how strong the stock exchange is – fall over the years, compared to stock markets in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. As these emerging economies mature, they will continue to attract more investor attention.

**COVID-19**

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic had forced governments to close their borders, halt economic activity, and make people stay at home. With the global economy coming to a partial standstill, Singapore was deeply affected.

Flash estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed that the Singapore economy had contracted 2.2 per cent, setting the country on course for its worst recession since independence.
