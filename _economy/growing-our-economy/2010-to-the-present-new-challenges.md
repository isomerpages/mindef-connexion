#### 2010 to the Present: New Challenges

Singapore continues to face structural challenges as well as short-term obstacles. 


**A Mature Phase of Growth**

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/economy/growing-our-economy/Screenshot%202020-10-19%20at%201.png)

By 2011, it was clear that as Singapore's economy had matured, growth would slow to 3-5 % growth per year. Even though our innovations (e.g. Jurong Rock Cavens) have stretched our limits, the fact is that resource and land constraints remain.

**Ageing Population**

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>The life expectancy in Singapore has risen to from 76.1 in 1990 to 83.2 in 2018. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will likely be older than 65. The median age is projected to rise from 39 in 2011 to 47 in 2030. </p>

<p>Moreover, efforts to boost the natural rate of population growth have had little success. Singapore's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) was 1.14 in 2018 -- below the replacement rate of 2.1.</p>
</div>

The ageing population will have a significant impact on Singapore’s economy in the long term.

Without a sufficient pool of younger workers to replace older workers, our economy could start to lose its dynamism and vibrancy. Talent is a critical component for companies in the knowledge-based economy, but companies could struggle to find the talent they need here. This would make Singapore far less attractive than its neighbours, which have younger population bases.

The ageing workforce also puts strains on other parts of the Singapore economy, especially our fiscal position. Income tax collections could start to decline with a smaller workforce, which would constrain the government’s ability to spend. At the same time, there will be a need to continue raising social spending, which has risen from S$15 billion in 2009 to S$30 billion in 2018.

<b>Rise in Populist Nationalism and Anti-Trade/Globalisation Forces </b>

In 2016, Britain's vote to leave the European Union shocked many, and disquieted the notion of European Unity and the common market. While there were socio-economic and political reasons that prompted the majority of Britons to vote Leave, it can be seen as a symptom of a larger rise in populist politics in the world. 

A by-product of populist sentiments is the rise of [protectionist ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/protectionism)policies, and the rejection of globalisation, free trade, and open borders. 

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>US-China trade tensions: In 2018 and 2019, the world’s two largest economies started levying tariffs on each other, which dampened global trade and the world economy. </p>

<p>The rising tensions have also spilled over into the technology sector, such as when the US government banned US companies from using technology from Huawei. While the US and China signed a pact to ease trade tensions in early 2020, this hasty deterioration of trade relations underscore how quickly Singapore's external environment can shift.</p>
</div>

The rise of protectionism reduces trade, and raises the prices of imports and exports. It also slows growth rates for countries. 

In the long run, the rise of populist sentiments also brings skepticism multi-lateral organisations and fora, such as the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

For instance, the US pulled out of the Paris Agreement unilaterally in June 2017, threatening to overturn progress made so far in the landmark climate change pact. However, the US under President Joe Biden has since rejoined the agreement (Feb 2021). Likewise, the WTO, which is the primary forum for countries to resolve trade conflicts has been criticsed for being complacent and ineffective. 

This puts Singapore in a difficult spot, as small countries require such organisations and international law to have a voice and resolve conflicts with larger powers.

As PM Lee said, multilateral organisations such as the UN and WTO are critical to Singapore’s survival:

**Digital Disruption: A Source of Challenges and Opportunities**

Digital technology has reshaped the way we work, live and play. Whether it is Facebook and how it is changed our social circle, or how Grab has redefined the taxi industry, technological disruption is on the rise.

The advent of technologies such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing and robotics is revolutionising manufacturing, while big data has given companies new ways to understand their consumers. This in turn is quickly changing the rules of the game for companies. If they are armed with the right idea, capital and networks, small companies can quickly scale up to displace large and slower incumbents.

This offers a range of new challenges and opportunities for Singapore for Singapore.

On the one hand, digital technologies have the potential to make quantum leaps on productivity, generating billions in additional economic value. However, digital disruption, if not managed well, could lead to social issues.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>For instance, the rise of robots has led some to believe that there could be huge job losses. Large companies which employ thousands of people could find themselves disrupted quickly if they do not move fast enough.  </p>

<p>Workers could also find themselves out of a job if they hold on to obsolete skills. New types of workers, including those from the gig economy have risen. </p>
</div>

The challenge for governments around the world, including Singapore, is managing these challenges while positioning the economy to benefit from these forms of digital disruption.

**New Competition from Regional Rivals**

Singapore remains one of the top destinations for investment largely because it has kept its status as a key transport, financial, maritime and technology hub. However, major cities around the region are challenging Singapore in various fields.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are aiming to be the regional hubs for air travel. The governments of both countries have spent massively to upgrade existing airport infrastructure. This is partly why we have had to be forward-looking in order to stay ahead of the competition.  </p>

<p>China’s Belt and Road Initiative will see billions of dollars being poured into the region to build infrastructure, from roads to ports. While stronger connectivity helps keep lines of communication open, some of these ports and airports could rise to become our competitors along the way.</p>
</div>

Likewise on the financial front, Singapore may have a significant lead over neighbouring countries as a financial hub but competition is quickly hotting up.

The Singapore Exchange has seen trading volumes – an indicator of how strong the stock exchange is – fall over the years, compared to stock markets in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. As these emerging economies mature, they will continue to attract more investor attention.

**COVID-19**

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic had forced governments to close their borders, halt economic activity, and make people stay at home. With the global economy coming to a partial standstill, Singapore was deeply affected.

Flash estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed that the Singapore economy had contracted 2.2 per cent, setting the country on course for its worst recession since independence.
