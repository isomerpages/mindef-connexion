#### 1997 to 2009: Overcoming Multiple Crises

In 1997, the [Asian Financial Crisis](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/87709dd7-72ae-47e2-876c-60544bb25e00) swept the region, toppling governments and bankrupting companies, governments and individuals. Singapore was also affected, sinking into a deep recession in 1998. Thousands of Singaporeans lost their jobs, as companies folded under the poor economic conditions.

It was the first of many crises that marked this 12-year period, one of the most difficult in Singapore’s short history as an independent nation. Soon after the Asian Financial Crisis, Singapore was buffeted by[ SARS](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1529_2009-06-03.html) in 2003 which deeply impacted travel in the region. The world was then confronted with the [Global Financial Crisis](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/3cacf256-82cc-4776-b7f8-83757723b502) in 2008.

Fortunately, we were able to weather these crises well, largely due to our strong reserves and prudent fiscal policy.

<p>Singapore’s Constitution states that the government’s budget must be balanced over its term of office. This means that the government of the day cannot spend beyond its means. Over the years, the government has been regularly recording surpluses that it saves as reserves. Past reserves cannot be spent without the approval of the Elected President. This ensures fiscal sustainability and prevents irresponsible spending. These reserves have, in turn, been invested to generate returns.</p>

<p>The reserves acts as a buffer against external shocks as it did in 1997. Even though Singapore was not spared from the financial contagion, we were much less affected than our neighbouring countries.  Similarly, Singapore was able to draw on its reserves during one of the worst global financial crises since the Great Depression in 1929. The Great Financial Crisis in 2008 saw the collapse of some of the biggest banks and threatened to tip the world over into another depression. Governments rallied to prevent the catastrophe, spending trillions in the process. Singapore’s government also took major steps to prevent the economic meltdown. In 2009, Singapore tapped its reserves for the first time in its history to fund the $4.2 billion Jobs Credit and Special Risk-Sharing Initiative. Both schemes, aimed at saving jobs and supporting businesses, were part of a bigger $20.5 billion Resilience Package. The measures worked – in 2010, Singapore’s economy grew 10 per cent, among the fastest in the world. The strong economic recovery allowed the government to later return the $4 billion to the reserves.</p>

<p>The strong reserves also give the government additional spending power to plan for Singapore’s future. In recent years, the laws have been tweaked to allow the government to draw on the returns from the reserves to fund its budget under the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) framework. </p>

This sustainable approach to budgeting has had multiple benefits.

The returns generated over the years have been used by the government for its spending. For instance, between FY2015 and FY 2020, the NIRC supplied the government with about $90 billion of additional funds. Examples of large-ticket items that have been directly or indirectly funded by the returns include the Pioneer Generation Package, upgrading of transport infrastructure and the rise in social spending.

The government has also regularly distributed the surpluses to Singaporeans so the wider population can share in the country’s growing wealth.

The reserves were built by a country that had no natural resources, but through discipline and the hard work of its people, noted Mr Heng:
