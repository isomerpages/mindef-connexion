#### 1979 to 1984: Economic Restructuring

By the late 1970s, there were more capital-intensive industries that were set up in Singapore. Using incentives to attract foreign investors and companies was working but the pace was not quick enough.

**1979: Three-Year Corrective Wage Policy**

In order to accelerate the economic restructuring programme, the National Wages Council (NWC) adopted a three-year corrective wage policy in 1979. This consisted of strong wage increases as well as hikes in the CPF contribution rates to reflect the full employment state of Singapore’s economy.

The efforts paid off, as companies quickly began adopting higher-value work. At the same time, companies producing lower-value products moved to cheaper offshore locations.

Net investments between 1980 and 1984 averaged $1.7 billion a year, led by an expansion in high value-added industries such as computers, electronics, machinery and pharmaceutical products.

**Investing in Infrastructure**

At the same time, Singapore continued make bold investments in upgrading our infrastructure to facilitate and improve international connectivity.

As a small city-state, we are heavily dependent on international aviation links to the rest of the world. That was why Singapore’s leaders took an early interest in the development of Singapore’s aviation links and airports.

In 1966, just a year after independence, Singapore became a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a body under the United Nations.

Founding PM Mr Lee Kuan Yew also advocated moving the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi in the 1970s. This went against the advice of foreign experts who had suggested building a second runway at Paya Lebar instead. The decision would mean writing off some $800 million that had been spent on Paya Lebar with another $1.5 billion to be spent on developing the airport in Changi.

Despite the challenges, Mr Lee believed that it was the right decision. For one thing, building the airport near the sea would provide the space needed to grow its capacity for future needs. An airport near the sea would also reduce the noise pollution on residents, with the aircraft flying into Singapore over the sea. Singapore went ahead to build Changi Airport.

<p>By the time Changi Airport was opened in 1981, it had already racked up a list of achievements.  It was ranked then as Asia’s largest airport, alongside Tokyo’s Narita Airport. It also had the world’s largest column-free hangar, spanning 20,000 sq m. It was also completed in just six years, a time frame that many experts called record-breaking.</p>

<p>More importantly, the airport was a symbol of Singapore’s ambitions and showcased our drive and efficiency. The move allowed Changi Airport to continuously grow its capacity and upgrade its facilities. Indeed, by 1990, just nine years later, a second terminal was opened. By 1991, Changi Airport was handling more than 15.1 million passengers a year, nearly double the 8.1 million passengers when it was first opened.  </p>

By the end of the restructuring period, Singapore had succeeded in attracting high-value, capital intensive industries and companies.

However, the restructuring came with a cost: the corrective wage policy coupled with the slump in global demand caused Singapore to enter into its first recession in 1985.
