The rapid industrialisation drive in the 1960s was incredibly successful.

Investment commitments between 1968 and 1973 amounted to more than $2.3 billion, mostly from the petroleum and electronics sectors. Real GDP grew at an impressive pace of 13 percent annually from 1966 to 1973. Manufacturing’s share of the economy also rose from 16.0 percent to 22.3 percent over the same period.

Employment in the manufacturing sector grew by more than 50 per cent between 1966 and 1969, from 51,272 to about 87,128. Unemployment rate dropped from 8.9 percent in 1966 to 4.5 percent in 1973. Thousands of Singaporeans enjoyed good jobs and better pay. The surge in wealth was accompanied by a corresponding rise in living standards.

#### Facing and Tackling a New Problem: Labour Shortage

The push to develop labour-intensive industries was so effective that by the 1970s, labour surplus turned into a labour shortage.

With a limited supply of manpower, labour costs started to rise. At the same time, countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia were just firing up their industralisation plans. With large pools of labour, they posed direct competition to Singapore. Thus, tackling the labour shortage problem became a consistent theme throughout the 1970s.

In order to keep growing, Singapore had to adjust its economic strategy away from labour-intensive industries and into higher-value goods. This would ensure that Singapore’s workers continue to see a flow of jobs and income.

In 1973, then Finance Minister Mr Hon Sui Sen announced a two-pronged approach to tackle the labour shortage in Singapore. One, attract new foreign investment in higher-value manufacturing, such as petrochemicals and precision engineering. Two, to upgrade and upskill workers across the economy in a bid to raise productivity.


<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>1. To attract new higher-value industries to Singapore, the government provided tax incentives for targeted industries. One higher-value industry that grew rapidly during this period was the oil and petrochemical industry.  </p>

<p>The oil industry has been in Singapore since the late 19th century, functioning as a regional distribution centre for kerosene. It was only in the 1960s that oil majors started to invest big in Singapore. Between 1961 and 1973, four refineries were built and commissioned. </p>

<p>In his 1974 Budget statement, Minister Hon said that the economic upgrading strategy had started to pay off, noting that total investment commitments in manufacturing jumped from $336 million in 1972 to $819 million in 1973, led by higher technology industries, such as petroleum and petrochemical products. By the late 1970s, Singapore had became one of the largest refining centres in the world, with a capacity of more than 1.2 million barrels a day.</p>

<p>2. Investing in the people was another important aspect of growing the economy. In his speech to Parliament in 1970, Dr Goh Keng Swee said that there was an urgent need to tackle a looming skills gap, one that was going to hurt the economy by the mid-1970s. The economy needed engineers, highly skilled technicians and business management graduates to continue powering its growth.</p>

<p>The result was a concerted effort to boost human resources, starting with the strengthening of the education system. The government also focused on raising the productivity of workers, as part of overall efforts to overcome the small workforce disadvantage. While this was part of the economic plan as early as in the 1960s, the productivity policy was formally launched in the 1970s. This culminated in Singapore’s first national productivity campaign, launched by Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam in 1975. </p>

The economy performed well in the 1970s, with real GDP growing an average of 9.2 per cent between 1970 and 1980. With a strong manufacturing base and an increasingly educated workforce, the basic building blocks of Singapore’s modern city-state economy were put in place.

#### 1979 to 1984: Economic Restructuring

By the late 1970s, there were more capital-intensive industries that were set up in Singapore. Using incentives to attract foreign investors and companies was working but the pace was not quick enough.

**1979: Three-Year Corrective Wage Policy**

In order to accelerate the economic restructuring programme, the National Wages Council (NWC) adopted a three-year corrective wage policy in 1979. This consisted of strong wage increases as well as hikes in the CPF contribution rates to reflect the full employment state of Singapore’s economy.

The efforts paid off, as companies quickly began adopting higher-value work. At the same time, companies producing lower-value products moved to cheaper offshore locations.

Net investments between 1980 and 1984 averaged $1.7 billion a year, led by an expansion in high value-added industries such as computers, electronics, machinery and pharmaceutical products.

**Investing in Infrastructure**

At the same time, Singapore continued make bold investments in upgrading our infrastructure to facilitate and improve international connectivity.

As a small city-state, we are heavily dependent on international aviation links to the rest of the world. That was why Singapore’s leaders took an early interest in the development of Singapore’s aviation links and airports.

In 1966, just a year after independence, Singapore became a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a body under the United Nations.

Founding PM Mr Lee Kuan Yew also advocated moving the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi in the 1970s. This went against the advice of foreign experts who had suggested building a second runway at Paya Lebar instead. The decision would mean writing off some $800 million that had been spent on Paya Lebar with another $1.5 billion to be spent on developing the airport in Changi.

Despite the challenges, Mr Lee believed that it was the right decision. For one thing, building the airport near the sea would provide the space needed to grow its capacity for future needs. An airport near the sea would also reduce the noise pollution on residents, with the aircraft flying into Singapore over the sea. Singapore went ahead to build Changi Airport.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>By the time Changi Airport was opened in 1981, it had already racked up a list of achievements.  It was ranked then as Asia’s largest airport, alongside Tokyo’s Narita Airport. It also had the world’s largest column-free hangar, spanning 20,000 sq m. It was also completed in just six years, a time frame that many experts called record-breaking.</p>

<p>More importantly, the airport was a symbol of Singapore’s ambitions and showcased our drive and efficiency. The move allowed Changi Airport to continuously grow its capacity and upgrade its facilities. Indeed, by 1990, just nine years later, a second terminal was opened. By 1991, Changi Airport was handling more than 15.1 million passengers a year, nearly double the 8.1 million passengers when it was first opened.  </p>

By the end of the restructuring period, Singapore had succeeded in attracting high-value, capital intensive industries and companies.

However, the restructuring came with a cost: the corrective wage policy coupled with the slump in global demand caused Singapore to enter into its first recession in 1985.

#### 1986 to 1996: Rebounding into a Decade of Growth

The 1985 recession was a painful but important reminder that the country could not afford to stand still. The growth we saw prior to the recession was flagging, as resource constraints and the diminishing returns of investment had started to kick in. Change was necessary.

The challenge for our economy were clear: could we restructure the economy in order to capture new opportunities while staying ahead of the competition which was emerging from other fast-industrialising economies such as Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan?

Change came in the form of new directions and creating different engines of growth. One was to diversify Singapore’s economy by developing multiple areas of growth. Another was to expand our presence overseas. These efforts fortified resilience in the economy and created buffers to mitigate future downturns.

We took on the challenge and emerged stronger than before.

**Growing the Financial Sector**

One key niche area that had become increasingly important to Singapore was its financial sector.

While local banks such as OCBC, UOB and OUB have been stalwarts, their main business prior to independence was supporting Chinese merchants and traders. Once industralisation took off, however, these banks, including DBS, became full commercial banks that financed a wider array of financial activities.

In the late 1960s, the development of the Asian Dollar Market helped establish Singapore as a leading foreign exchange market after London New York and Tokyo.

By the 1980s, financial services had become one of the biggest drivers of economic growth. In 1983, for instance, the financial sector alone accounted for about 30 percent of overall GDP growth.

The 1980s and 1990s also saw Singapore intensify efforts to develop fee-based financial activities such as fund management, stock trading activities and insurance.

**Growing the Tourism Sector**

Another area that was given much focus in the 1980s was tourism – in 1981, the government identified the tourism industry as one of the pillars of growth in its 10-year economic development plan. In 1984, a tourism task force headed by then Minister of State for Trade and Industry Wong Kwei Cheong was convened to look at revitalising and promoting Singapore as a major tourist destination.

The task force recommended developing new tourism attractions such as a new indoor stadium that could host concerts and conventions. It also called for the government to preserve historical areas such as Chinatown, places full of rich historical and cultural tradition.

**Strengthening the Manufacturing Sector**

At the same time, The government also continued the multi-year drive to upgrade our industries and move up the value chain.

In manufacturing, we moved to further deepen our expertise in high-value manufacturing including production, testing and assembly.

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>For instance, we built on Singapore’s expertise in electronics and precision engineering. This helped Singapore benefit greatly from the growth of personal computing. </p>

<p>From 1986 to 1996, Singapore produced about 45 to 50 percent of the world’s hard disks, making Singapore a critical global node for hard-disc drives. </p>
</div>

Moreover, to ensure that we did not become over-reliant on electronics, we also diversified within the manufacturing sector.

The government embarked on an ambitious plan to develop a petrochemicals facility that would entrench Singapore as a global petrochemicals hub. Jurong Island is a man-made island that combined the best of Singapore – forward thinking, a dare-to-do-and-dream attitude as well as the ability to deliver the final product.
