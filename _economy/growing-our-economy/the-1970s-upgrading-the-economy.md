The rapid industrialisation drive in the 1960s was incredibly successful.

Investment commitments between 1968 and 1973 amounted to more than $2.3 billion, mostly from the petroleum and electronics sectors. Real GDP grew at an impressive pace of 13 percent annually from 1966 to 1973. Manufacturing’s share of the economy also rose from 16.0 percent to 22.3 percent over the same period.

Employment in the manufacturing sector grew by more than 50 per cent between 1966 and 1969, from 51,272 to about 87,128. Unemployment rate dropped from 8.9 percent in 1966 to 4.5 percent in 1973. Thousands of Singaporeans enjoyed good jobs and better pay. The surge in wealth was accompanied by a corresponding rise in living standards.

#### Facing and Tackling a New Problem: Labour Shortage

The push to develop labour-intensive industries was so effective that by the 1970s, labour surplus turned into a labour shortage.

With a limited supply of manpower, labour costs started to rise. At the same time, countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia were just firing up their industralisation plans. With large pools of labour, they posed direct competition to Singapore. Thus, tackling the labour shortage problem became a consistent theme throughout the 1970s.

In order to keep growing, Singapore had to adjust its economic strategy away from labour-intensive industries and into higher-value goods. This would ensure that Singapore’s workers continue to see a flow of jobs and income.

In 1973, then Finance Minister Mr Hon Sui Sen announced a two-pronged approach to tackle the labour shortage in Singapore. One, attract new foreign investment in higher-value manufacturing, such as petrochemicals and precision engineering. Two, to upgrade and upskill workers across the economy in a bid to raise productivity.

<p>1. To attract new higher-value industries to Singapore, the government provided tax incentives for targeted industries. One higher-value industry that grew rapidly during this period was the oil and petrochemical industry.  </p>

<p>The oil industry has been in Singapore since the late 19th century, functioning as a regional distribution centre for kerosene. It was only in the 1960s that oil majors started to invest big in Singapore. Between 1961 and 1973, four refineries were built and commissioned. </p>

<p>In his 1974 Budget statement, Minister Hon said that the economic upgrading strategy had started to pay off, noting that total investment commitments in manufacturing jumped from $336 million in 1972 to $819 million in 1973, led by higher technology industries, such as petroleum and petrochemical products. By the late 1970s, Singapore had became one of the largest refining centres in the world, with a capacity of more than 1.2 million barrels a day.</p>

<p>2. Investing in the people was another important aspect of growing the economy. In his speech to Parliament in 1970, Dr Goh Keng Swee said that there was an urgent need to tackle a looming skills gap, one that was going to hurt the economy by the mid-1970s. The economy needed engineers, highly skilled technicians and business management graduates to continue powering its growth.</p>

<p>The result was a concerted effort to boost human resources, starting with the strengthening of the education system. The government also focused on raising the productivity of workers, as part of overall efforts to overcome the small workforce disadvantage. While this was part of the economic plan as early as in the 1960s, the productivity policy was formally launched in the 1970s. This culminated in Singapore’s first national productivity campaign, launched by Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam in 1975. </p>

The economy performed well in the 1970s, with real GDP growing an average of 9.2 per cent between 1970 and 1980. With a strong manufacturing base and an increasingly educated workforce, the basic building blocks of Singapore’s modern city-state economy were put in place.
