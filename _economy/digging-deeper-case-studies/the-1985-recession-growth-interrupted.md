#### The 1985 Recession: Growth Interrupted
<i>2 minute read</i>

After enjoying uninterrupted growth for nearly 20 years, Singapore faced its first recession in 1985, an episode which tested the country’s resolve in managing crises.

The factors that contributed to the sharp decline in economic activity were varied. For one, the patchy external global economy was a key factor. Dragged by a slowdown in the US, demand for Singapore’s exports fell sharply.

Singapore’s economy was also grappling with several cyclical and structural problems.

One key factor was the slump in construction. In the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Singapore went through a major construction boom, contributing almost a third of economic growth during the period. This was unsustainable and when the boom ended, the economy dived.

A deeper problem lay in the structural make-up of the economy – while the wage correction policy helped hasten Singapore’s move up the value chain, the acceleration of rising costs also caused Singapore to lose competitiveness.

The government quickly sprang into action. In March 1985, then Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Tony Tan formed the Economic Committee. Helmed by then Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry Mr Lee Hsien Loong, the committee was tasked to study the recession and what Singapore could do to recover from it. Titled “The Singapore Economy: New Directions”, the report, published in 1986, listed several policy reforms.

The first issue was to tackle production costs, in particular labour costs. The committee recommended slashing the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution by 15 per cent, with temporary wage restraints put in place as well. Corporate tax was also reduced by 7 percent. The committee also recommended cutting corporate and income taxes and for companies to embark on wage reform to introduce flexibility in wages.

By 1987, Singapore‘s growth rate leapt to 10.8 percent, kicking off a period of strong growth that would last well into the 1990s.

For the longer-term outlook, the committee said Singapore should continue with moving up the value chain. It also suggested looking at developing and exporting services, and moving beyond functioning as an offshore production base. At the same time, Singapore should continue to develop itself into a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. This included having competitive taxes and a strong regulatory regime to strengthen the corporate sector.

The ability to beat off the recession was the product of a decisive government and a people willing to take a bitter pill for long-term gain, said then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 1986:
