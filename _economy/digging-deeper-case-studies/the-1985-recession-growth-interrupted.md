#### The 1985 Recession: Growth Interrupted
<i>2 minute read</i>

After enjoying uninterrupted growth for nearly 20 years, Singapore faced its first recession in 1985, which tested our resolve and crisis management. 

The recession was caused by several factors, including weak economic growth globally which slowed demand for Singapore’s exports, as well as structural problems within our economy.

One key factor was the slump in construction. In the late-1970s to the early-1980s, Singapore went through a major construction boom, contributing to almost a third of economic growth during the period. However, with booms come busts, and economic growth declined when this happened. 

This problem was caused by deeper issues in the our economic structure. While the wage correction policy hastened Singapore’s move up the value chain, the acceleration of rising costs also decreased our competitiveness.

In March 1985, then-Minister for Trade and Industry Tony Tan formed the Economic Committee. Helmed by then-Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry Lee Hsien Loong, the committee was tasked to study the recession and Singapore's recovery. It published a refort, “The Singapore Economy: New Directions”, in 1986, and recommended several policy reforms.

The first issue was to tackle production costs, especially labour costs. It recommended slashing the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution by 15%, with temporary wage restraints put in place as well. Corporate tax was also reduced by 7%. The committee also recommended cutting corporate and income taxes and for companies to embark on wage reform to introduce flexibility in wages.

By 1987, Singapore‘s growth rate leapt to 10.8 percent, kicking off a period of strong growth that would last well into the 1990s.

For the longer-term outlook, the committee said Singapore should continue with moving up the value chain. It also suggested looking at developing and exporting services, and moving beyond functioning as an offshore production base. At the same time, Singapore should continue to develop itself into a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. This included having competitive taxes and a strong regulatory regime to strengthen the corporate sector.

The ability to beat off the recession was the product of a decisive government and a people willing to take a bitter pill for long-term gain, said then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 1986:
