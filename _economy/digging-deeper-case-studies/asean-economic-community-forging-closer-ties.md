Southeast Asia is home to some of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is poised to become the fourth-largest economy by 2030. And the region’s prospects can burn even brighter once it achieves economic integration and a single common market, a goal that began in 2003.

The outlook in the early 2000s for global free trade looked poor. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was not able to move ahead with plans to liberalise trade. Countries such as the European Union and the United States sought to create their own bilateral deals, bypassing WTO altogether.

It was during this period that then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong mooted the idea of a single market for ASEAN. He called it the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), “a single production base and a single market, with free movement of goods, services and capital. This is the only way to make sure we remain competitive in the face of growing regional and bilateral FTAs, post-Cancun”.

By liberalising trade, the region’s GDP could increase by “at least 10 per cent”, and reduce operational costs by “up to 20 per cent”. This would translate to a U$50 billion boon to Asean’s GDP.

It was not until 2007 that the first AEC blueprint was drawn up, and the declaration for it signed. The first phase of the plan was to move towards closer integration by 2015, with intermittent checkpoints along the way.

One of its key aims was for the region to eliminate most intra-regional tariffs and remove formal restrictions in the services sector; simplify cross-border trading process and develop a more attractive investment business-friendly environment, by adopting common frameworks and standards.

In the seven-year period that followed, trade in ASEAN grew by U$1 trillion. Singapore’s businesses were also now able to tap on the 600 million consumers in the region.

Building on the first phase, the next lap of economic integration is expected to be complete by 2025, with the eventual goal of establishing ASEAN as a single market, with the free flow of trade and investment among the 10 member states. It will prepare the region for new areas such as e-commerce, and liberate the region further with the removal of non-tariff barriers.

The AEC goes beyond promoting free trade amongst regional economies. As a bloc, the AEC will have tremendous influence when dealing with other big trading partners such as China and Europe. It will also attract large amounts of investments, with investors eager to be part of the exciting growth story.

More importantly, closer integration will anchor stability within the region and promote cooperation among member states. For Singapore, this is an invaluable part of its foreign trade efforts and will keep Singapore as an attractive location for companies looking to expand into the region.
