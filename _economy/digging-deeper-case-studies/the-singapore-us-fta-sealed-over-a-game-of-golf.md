The late 1990s was a tough period for the Singapore economy. It was still reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis which had swept over the region, disrupted economies and bankrupted hundreds of large companies. The global outlook was looking grim. Free trade talks had taken a hit with the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Talks stalling.

Faced with dim prospects, Singapore decided that it would chart its own economic future by pushing for free trade agreements with its key trading partners, said former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2014.

Singapore had an ambitious plan to signal its intention: seal an FTA with the world’s largest economy, the United States.

In order to get any deal done, then US President Bill Clinton had to give his approval, but Singapore’s relationship with the White House was at a low point at the time.

<p>Singapore had angered some parts of the US government because it had sentenced American teenager Michael Fay to six strokes of the cane for vandalism and theft, a case that gained international media attention. </p>

<p>The US government pressured Singapore for clemency for Fay but the Singapore government stood its ground, arguing that Singaporeans would also be given the same sentence if found guilty of the same crime. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, then President Ong Teng Cheong reduced the number of strokes from six to four out of respect to President Clinton. Many US lawmakers criticised the decision and, as a result, the White House refused to let PM Goh meet with President Clinton. </p>

Instead of forcing his way into the White House, PM Goh decided to go through the informal way – via a game of golf.

Through a mutual friend, President Clinton, who is a keen golfer, learnt about PM Goh’s passion for golf. When the opportunity presented itself in 1997 during an APEC Leaders’ meeting in Vancouver, both leaders played a game of golf. That set the stage for further discussions, which took place again on the green some three years later at another APEC Leaders’ meeting in 2000 in Brunei.

Following the end of the banquet in Brunei, PM Goh approached President Clinton to ask if he would be up for a game of golf. President Clinton said yes.

They played a game of 18 holes. After which, PM Goh made his pitch:

Officially signed in 2003 and implemented a year later, the US-Singapore FTA was the first FTA signed between the US and East Asia. The FTA removes tariffs and allows for better movement of goods between the two nations.

The FTA was a powerful signal to the rest of the world.

It showed that despite its size, Singapore could persuade the world’s biggest economy to ink a deal on free trade. As a result, the FTA set an important precedent for future FTAs to be negotiated.
