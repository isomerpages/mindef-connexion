The late-1990s was a difficult time for Singapore. Our economy was still struggling after the Asian Financial Crisis, and global outlook was grim. Moreover, the Doha Talks by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had stalled. 

Faced with dim prospects, Singapore decided that it had to chart its own economic future by pushing for free trade agreements with its key trading partners, said former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2014.

Singapore had an ambitious plan to signal its intention -- seal an FTA with the world’s largest economy, the United States. However, Singapore’s relationship with the White House was at a low point at the time.

<p>The US government pressured Singapore for clemency for Fay but the Singapore government stood its ground, insisting that Singaporeans would also be given the same sentence if found guilty of the same crime. </p>

Instead of forcing his way into the White House, PM Goh decided to go through the informal way – via a game of golf.

Through a mutual friend, President Clinton, who is a keen golfer, learnt about PM Goh’s passion for golf. When the opportunity presented itself in 1997 during an APEC Leaders’ meeting in Vancouver, both leaders played a game of golf. That set the stage for further discussions, which took place again on the green some three years later at another APEC Leaders’ meeting in 2000 in Brunei.

Following the end of the banquet in Brunei, PM Goh approached President Clinton to ask if he would be up for a game of golf. President Clinton said yes.

They played a game of 18 holes. After which, PM Goh made his pitch:

Officially signed in 2003 and implemented a year later, the US-Singapore FTA was the first FTA signed between the US and East Asia. The FTA removes tariffs and allows for better movement of goods between the two nations.

The FTA was a powerful signal to the rest of the world.

It showed that despite its size, Singapore could persuade the world’s biggest economy to ink a deal on free trade. As a result, the FTA set an important precedent for future FTAs to be negotiated.
