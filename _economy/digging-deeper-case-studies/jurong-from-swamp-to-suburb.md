Littered with villages and crocodile-infested rivers, Jurong used to be nothing more than swampland until then-Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee mooted the idea of turning Jurong into the centre of Singapore’s early industrialisation plans.

It was a risky plan given that Singapore had little experience in creating an industrial town of this size. According to the late Sim Kee Boon, a former Permanent Secretary at various ministries, then-Minister Goh himself admitted that the Jurong project was “an act of faith".

EDB was tasked to transform Jurong into a hub of factories and industrial activities, a responsibility that was later devolved to Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) which was set up as a separate agency in 1968.

The project involved developing a 9,000 acre piece of land in Jurong, a complex task that involved land reclamation, resettling villagers and building infrastructure such as roads, power lines and water supply.

By the time the industrial estate was ready to be launched in 1963, foreign investors were still unsure about Singapore and Jurong. However, with tax incentives and a persuasive group of EDB officers, investors started to trickle in. The first company to set up a factory was the [National Iron and Steel Mills](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2018-11-20_105235.html) in 1964, and Jurong never looked back.

Over the next few years, Jurong would become the centrepiece of Singapore’s early industrialisation efforts, a bustling hub of factories and workers. Within three years, by the end of 1967, Jurong Industrial Estate had attracted investments worth a total of about $178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for some 6,500 workers.

More than just a collection of factories, Dr Goh saw Jurong as an entire town, with amenities to boot. He commented that “life in Jurong cannot be other than spartan”.

JTC also oversaw the construction of recreational facilities, a town centre and housing flats to cater to the growing population in Jurong Town. Over the years, these extended to include the Jurong Bird Park, Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden and Jurong Park, among others. Roads, stadiums and hospitals were also constructed.

Today, the future of Jurong remains bright. The 360ha Jurong Lake District has been earmarked to be Singapore’s second central business district (CBD). Development plans include a commercial precinct, housing and expanded gardens.
