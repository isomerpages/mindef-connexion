In the 1960s, farmland occupied 14,000 hectares of land in Singapore, but by 1988, that number was just 2,037 hectares. Today, Singapore’s 5.7 million citizens rely largely on imported food, with just 10 per cent of what they eat being sourced locally.

While this means that Singapore has access to the global market of different types of food, it also exposes Singapore to the “volatilities of the global food market”, said Minister for Environment and Resources Masagos Zulkifli.

It was with this in mind that Singapore launched the “30 by 30” plan in 2019, a drive to ensure that the country can produce 30 per cent of the food it consumes annually by 2030.

This may seem daunting given that Singapore does not have large tracts of land to support farming activities. The development of agri-technology is an example of how Singapore can continue to defy its physical limitations.

One early example was the Lim Chu Kang Agrotechnology Park, situated in an area once well-known for its vast plantations. Phase One was built in 1989, and one company there was able to cultivate temperate vegetables like lettuce in the tropical climate, a world’s first. The model was replicated in places like Mandai, Nee Soon and Sungei Tengah in phases over time.

Another example was the Marine Aquaculture Centre (MAC), opened in 2003. The centre led to the development of a new breed of sea bass which has a shorter incubation time and is more resistant to diseases. Half a million of these fishes were hatched at St. John’s Island, nurtured in Indonesia, and sent back to Singapore in a successful pilot test.

The latest agri-food push came in the form of a new 18-hectare site in Sungei Kadut in 2019. The Agri-Food Innovation Park at Sungei Kadut will bring together high-tech farming and R&D activities, including indoor plant factories, insect farms and animal feed production facilities. Enterprise Singapore also announced that it is co-investing up to $90 million in agri-tech start-ups.

Beyond simply ensuring Singapore’s food security, these efforts are also spawning fresh economic activity, as Singapore positions itself to take a big bite of the global $5 trillion agri-technology pie.
