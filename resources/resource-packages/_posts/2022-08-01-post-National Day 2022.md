Every year on 9 August, we celebrate National Day and how far we've come since independence. It is also a day where we come together in a spirit of joy, unity and confidence to pledge how we, as Singaporeans, will continue to build a stronger Singapore.

Commanders and Department Heads are encouraged to use the attached engagement package to commemorate National Day with your service personnel, to celebrate how far we've come, and how we continue to play a part in Singapore's future.
