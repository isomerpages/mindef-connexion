#### HDB Ethnic Integration Policy (1989)

In the 1980s, more than 20 years after HDB flats were introduced, there were signs that segregation among the races had once again started to take root. Malay households made up more than 30 per cent of the estate population in Bedok and Tampines while the Chinese formed more than 90 per cent of the households in Hougang. This was made worse by a growing resale market for HDB flats, where families tended to buy flats in areas with more residents of their own race.

Then-Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan warned that it would be “unthinkable” for Singapore to regress to the days before independence, when a certain place was seen as belonging to a certain ethnic or dialect group.

However, it was not possible to uproot residents to break up the enclaves, like in the resettlement exercise in the 1960s. People could still move to live close to others of the same race, as the reestablishment of enclaves at certain estates had shown. Hence, in 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) was introduced.

Then-Minister Dhanabalan, in introducing the policy to Parliament on 16 February 1989, called it a “open and clear policy”. The policy’s enforceable limits will ensure that the ethnic proportions are kept, which will prevent the races from “regrouping” even in the long run.

The policy stipulated that the  ratio of flats within neighbourhoods for the different ethnic groups: 22% for Malays, 84% for Chinese, and 10% for Indians and other minority groups. Within each block, the ratio for flats was 25% for Malays, 87% for Chinese, and 13% for Indians. These quotas have changed over the years, such as in 2010, where the neighbourhood- and block-level limits for Indians and other minority groups were raised to 12% and 15% respectively.
