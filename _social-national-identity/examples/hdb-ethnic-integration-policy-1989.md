#### HDB Ethnic Integration Policy (1989)

In the 1980s, more than 20 years after HDB flats were introduced, there were signs that segregation among the races had once again started to take root. Malay households made up more than 30 per cent of the estate population in Bedok and Tampines while the Chinese formed more than 90 per cent of the households in Hougang. This was made worse by a growing resale market for HDB flats, where families tended to buy flats in areas with more residents of their own race.

Then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan warned that it would be “unthinkable” for Singapore to regress to the days before independence, when a certain place was seen as belonging to a certain ethnic or dialect group.

Uprooting residents to break up the enclaves, like how it was done through a massive resettlement exercise in the 1960s, was not a viable option. People could still move to live close to others of the same race, as the reestablishment of enclaves at certain estates had shown. Hence, in 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced.

Mr Dhanabalan, in introducing the policy to Parliament on 16 February 1989, called it a “open and clear policy”. The policy’s enforceable limits will ensure that the ethnic proportions are kept, which will prevent the races from “regrouping” even in the long run.

The policy stipulated that the proportion of flats in each neighbourhood for Malays, Chinese, Indians and other minority groups would be 22 per cent, 84 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. The allowable proportion of flats in each block was set at 25 per cent for Malays, 87 per cent for Chinese and 13 per cent for Indians and other races.
