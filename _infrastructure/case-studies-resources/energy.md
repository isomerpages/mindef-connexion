Energy is a vital resource that is indispensable to a country’s development. But Singapore does not possess any significant energy resources of our own, and we depend heavily on energy imports to meet our domestic needs.
	
#### Singapore’s energy mix

Liquified natural gas (LNG), the cleanest fossil fuel, supplies about 95 per cent of our electricity generation needs. Coal, oil, solar and waste supply the remaining 5 per cent of our energy needs.

In 2019, we used about 9,795 kilotonnes (ktoe) of energy to generate about 4,655 ktoe of electricity, numbers which have been steadily rising.

But while we can procure what we need to keep our economy going and our hour homes running, we cannot simply rely on buying ever-larger amounts of energy. Singapore has been paying careful attention to maintaining energy security, economic competitiveness, and environmental sustainability - also known as the “energy trilemma”.
