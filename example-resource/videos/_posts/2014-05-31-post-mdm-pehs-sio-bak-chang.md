Every Dumpling Festival, Mdm Peh and her three daughters would gather to make at least 300 bak changs for their family and friends. 

Though it is easier to buy them, Mdm Peh insists on making the traditional dumplings from scratch as she believes her home-made ones taste far better. This is how she makes her Hokkien-style dumplings.
