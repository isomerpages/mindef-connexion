> Singaporeans love their curries! Unique to Singapore and Malaysia, Curry Fish head is an iconic dish made from stewing a red snapper (angkoli) head in a fragrant pot of curry with assorted vegetables.

The first instance of Curry Fish Head was clearly documented in The Straits Times. 

In the morning edition of the newspaper, it was reported a chinese restaurant by the name of Heng Kee was running a promotion for a new dish created by its head chef, Kah Li Yee.

There were several other reports by various media on this day:
* Daily Tribune: Reported the dish being sold out within 2 hours;
* The Orchard Press: Interview with Chef Kah Li Yee
* Radifussion: News report on the curry revolution sweeping Singapore
