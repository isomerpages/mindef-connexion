This year, Singapore marks Total Defence (TD) Day as we grapple with a challenge – the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The nCoV is a virus that can affect anyone – it does not matter what nationality or race. In 2003, Singapore was also threatened by another coronavirus in the same family, SARS. Just as we did back then, through Total Defence, we can stand together to contain the spread of the virus and ensure that Singapore keeps going strong.

The need for a strong Total Defence, in particular Psychological Defence, has been made especially salient by the ongoing outbreak. To overcome this crisis, we should remain psychologically prepared by staying calm and vigilant, be socially responsible and look out for one another. We should also practise good hygiene, taking precautions against nCoV, and share news responsibly.

Speakers may use the engagement package (Folio 1) to discuss the relevance of Total Defence and how each of us can help a part keeping Singapore strong, especially in today’s context.1 Please also find attached an infographic (Folio 2) which you may disseminate to your relevant audiences as well. To help you better understand Digital Defence, the sixth pillar of Total Defence which was introduced last year, you may refer to the Digital Defence factsheet, which can be found here: https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/portal/mindef/news-and-events/latest-releases/article-detail/2019/February/15feb19_fs.

Thank you.
